</div>


<p>December in Malta is very different from
that month in England. There is no
snow, no black frost, no fog; a bright,
turquoise-blue sky, and deep indigo sea,
smooth as glass, and dotted here and
there with the white sails of fishing-boats,
make a becoming background for this buff-coloured
island. The air is soft, yet exhilarating;
a perfume of oranges, cheroots,
and flowers pervades the atmosphere.
Little boys, with superb dark eyes, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
thrusting delicious bunches of roses and
heliotrope into the hands of passers-by, and
demanding “sixpence.” The new piano-organs
are grinding away mercilessly at
the corner of every street. A trooper, a
Peninsular and Oriental, and a vicious-looking
ironclad are all in simultaneously,
and Valetta is crammed. Such, at least,
was the scene one December afternoon,
not many years ago. It was the fashionable
hour; the Strada Reale was full of
shoppers, sightseers, and loungers; half
the garrison were strolling up and down.
Fat monks in brown, thin nuns in black,
fruitsellers, Maltese women in their picturesque
faldettas, soldiers, sailors, rich
men, poor men, beggar men, and no
doubt thieves, thronged the hot white
pavement.</p>

<p>Outside Marîche’s, the well-known tobacconist,
two young men, bearing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
unmistakable stamp of the British warrior
of the period, were smoking the inevitable
weed.</p>

<p>Cox, “the horsey,” with hands in pockets,
was holding forth at intervals, to Brown,
“the <i>blasé</i>,” and ladies’ man <i>par excellence</i>,
of the gallant smashers.</p>

<p>“Never saw such a hole as this is in my
life—<i>never</i>! No hunting, no shooting, no
sport of any kind. Think of all the tiptop
runs they are having at home now!
If <i>The Field</i> is to be believed, there
never was such going; nor, for the matter
of that, such grief. Here we are—stuck
on an island; water wherever you look;
not a horse worth twenty pounds in the
place!”</p>

<p>“Oh come, my dear fellow,” remonstrated
his friend, “what about the
Colonel’s barb, and half-a-dozen others I
could mention?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>“Well, not a <i>hunter</i>, at any rate, and
that’s all the same. If we are left here
another year, I believe I shall cut my
throat—or get <i>married</i>.”</p>

<p>Looking at his companion with critical
gravity, to see how he took this tremendous
alternative, but observing no wonderful
expression of alarm or anxiety
depicted on his face, he continued to puff
furiously at the cigar, which he held
almost savagely between his set teeth.
Suddenly he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“By Jove, there’s that Miss Saville
that all the fellows are talking about!
Why she’s nothing but a schoolgirl after
all.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, she is the prettiest girl
in Valetta,” replied Mr. Brown, taking
his cheroot out of his mouth and gazing
with an air of languid approval after
a tall slight figure, in a well-cut blue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
serge costume, that, in company with an
elderly lady, was crossing the Palace
Square.</p>

<p>“By the way, Brown, who <i>is</i> this Miss
Saville when she is at home?”</p>

<p>“Miss Saville,” replied Brown, propping
himself against the doorway, and evidently
preparing for a narrative, “is——In
the first place, an heiress, four thousand
a-year, my dear boy—think of that.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Encouraged by a nod from Cox, he
proceeded:</p>

<p>“She is also an orphan.”</p>

<p>“Good!” quoth Cox emphatically.</p>

<p>“But you need not run away with the
idea that she is an unprotected female.
She has a guardian,” continued his friend
impressively.</p>

<p>“It seems that her father, General
Saville, saved or made a lot of money out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
in India, and this girl was his only child.
Her mother died when she was a baby,
and she was sent home and received a
first-class education, including <i>all</i> the
extras. Are you listening?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am; get on with the
story.”</p>

<p>“Well, old Saville, who had always
meant to come home and live on his
fortune and repose on his laurels, trusted
too long to the climate, and left his bones
in the cemetery at Lahore, and his daughter
to his great chum, Sir Greville Fairfax,
with her fortune and her hand, both tightly
tied up, not to marry without his full
consent, not to come of age till she was
five-and-twenty, and all that sort of thing,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; go on.”</p>

<p>“Hurry no man’s cattle, the day is
young,” said Brown, removing his cheroot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
after two or three puffs, and contemplating
it with apparent interest.</p>

<p>“About six months later,” he proceeded
oracularly, “Sir Greville died suddenly of
heart disease, and it was found by his
will that he had passed on the guardianship
of the fair Alice to his son—to his
<i>son</i>, a young fellow of four-and-twenty,
a captain in the Fifth Hussars, and now
with his regiment in India. What do
you think of that?”</p>

<p>“Think!” returned his friend, with emphasis;
“I think it was meant as an
uncommonly strong hint for the son to
marry her.”</p>

<p>“And so he will, be sure. A pretty
girl, with four thousand pounds a-year
and no relations, is not to be had every
day. I only wish I had such a chance.
But I am afraid that a sub in a marching
regiment, with a pittance of a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
pounds a year and his pay, would be
rather out of the running.”</p>

<p>“You may say so,” replied Cox candidly,
plunging his hands still deeper into
his pockets. “That old dowager would
make short work of ‘the likes of you,’
as they say in the Green Isle.”</p>

<p>“No doubt she would. She is a Miss
Fane, an aunt of Fairfax’s, and has been
all autumn at Nice; and is now here
on a visit to the Lee-Dormers. Of
course she will keep the fair Alice for her
nephew.”</p>

<p>“How do you know all this? How do
you know her name is Alice?” inquired
Captain Cox.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know a good many things,”
returned his friend, with careless complacency,
resuming his cheroot and a
critical inspection of all passers-by.</p>

<p>His companion gazed at him for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
moments with a kind of sleepy admiration,
and then suddenly burst out:</p>

<p>“Is this Fairfax a dark, slim, good-looking
fellow? for I recollect a Fairfax,
an A1 rider, winning the Grand Military
at Punchestown some three years ago;
he was in the cavalry, I know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s he—Reginald Fairfax.
Since then he has been improving the
shining hour in the gorgeous East, tiger-shooting,
pig-sticking, polo-playing, and
so on. His regiment is in this season’s
reliefs, and, very likely, on its way home
now.”</p>

<p>“But the Fairfax I knew had lots of
coin, never went near a lady, and would
be the last man in the world to settle
down and get married. He cared for
nothing but sport of all kinds—hunting,
racing, shooting, and so on; and if he
is the identical guardian, Miss Saville is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
likely to remain Miss Saville as far as he
is concerned. Money would be no temptation
to him,” he concluded triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Well,” rejoined Mr. Brown, “if he
won’t marry her, someone else will; it
will be all the same to you and me.
Here, my cheroot is out; come along and
take a turn in the Strada, and give the
natives a treat.” <i>Exeunt</i>, arm-in-arm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br><span class="small">ALICE SAVILLE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Among the passengers who landed at Southampton
from the Peninsular and Oriental
<i>Rosetta</i>, one warm August afternoon in
the year 1858, was a stout well-to-do
Bengali ayah. Her stoutness spoke for
itself, her gold nose-jewel, heavy seed-pearl
earrings, massive necklet, bangles,
and toe-rings amply vouched for her
monetary ease. She carried on one arm
a thick black-and-red plaid shawl (her
own property), and on the other a pale,
fragile, wistful-looking infant, dressed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
a short white embroidered pelisse, white
bonnet, and enormous black sash.</p>

<p>This miserable puny little orphan had
lived and thriven, and developed into the
beauty and heiress alluded to by Captains
Brown and Cox.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>All through her early childhood she had
been the care, no less than the idol, of
her grand aunt and uncle Saville, an old
maid and an old bachelor, who resided
in an imposing but slightly dilapidated
mansion in the centre of a large wild-looking
demesne, near some unpronounceable
village in the south of Ireland.</p>

<p>Here, for nearly ten years, little Alice—thanks
to a supposed delicate constitution—was
allowed unlimited freedom from
lessons, lectures, punishments, and all the
restraints that young people of her years
specially detest. It was true that her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
fond aunt made a valiant attempt to “do
lessons” with her for one hour daily; but
how often was that hour curtailed in
deference to the pleading of a jovial,
indulgent old grand-uncle?</p>

<p>Allowed her own way almost entirely,
she brooked no constraint; for she had a
fine spirit, as her relations complacently
remarked. Her violent bursts of passion
were passed by unchecked. It was merely
the Saville temper, as much hereditary, and
seemingly as much to be proud of, as her
violet eyes and the far-famed Saville nose.
Mounted on her chestnut pony she would
accompany her uncle in his rides or scour
solus round the fields, with her long golden
hair streaming in the wind, looking far
more like a spirit than an ordinary Christian
child.</p>

<p>“Ay, but isn’t she the beautiful fair
creature to be born in that black country?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the servants and retainers would observe
to each other, with mingled admiration and
amazement.</p>

<p>At ten years of age Alice Saville could
barely read; wrote large intoxicated-looking
round-hand; knew nought of arithmetic,
sewing, or spelling; and was, without doubt,
as pretty and complete a little dunce as
could be found in the whole province of
Munster.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she had <i>some</i> accomplishments.
She was a wonderful rider for her
years, and could and would ride any colt
on the premises; gaily careering round and
round the lawn, and sticking on as if she
were part and parcel of the animal, to the
pride and delight of all beholders. Moreover,
she could jabber Irish, and was well
versed in all the old lore, legends, fairy-tales,
and superstitions current within the
four adjoining counties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Alice had ten years of boundless liberty,
and at the end of that time her uncle died,
his estate passed to the next heir, and his
sister, finding herself no longer the mistress
of a large liberally-kept establishment, but,
on the contrary, an old maid in straitened
circumstances, removed to a small house
in the suburbs of Dublin, and talked of
sending her niece to school.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Alarming rumours now began to reach
Sir Greville Fairfax. His ward was an
unkempt, uneducated, bare-legged little
wretch, running wild among the bogs of
Ireland. What a terrible picture was
conjured up before his mental vision. He
became at once alive to a sense of his
responsibilities, and sought the advice of
his most immediate matronly neighbours
without a day’s delay.</p>

<p>“She must be sent abroad!” this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the universal opinion, that rather disappointed
her guardian; for, to tell the truth,
he had had hopes of keeping her under his
own roof, with a governess to look after
her manners and education. Since his son
had gone to Sandhurst the house seemed
remarkably lonely and silent, and he would
have liked the child of his old friend
Maurice Saville to have made her home
with him. He had been her guardian
now for more than a year, and he had
actually never seen her. But when he
had taken the suffrages of his most
intimate lady-friends this hope was
quenched.</p>

<p>“She must be sent abroad” was their
verdict; nothing else could possibly counteract
that odious Irish accent. Lady Bertram
knew of such a charming establishment
where two of her nieces had been for
years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>Three miles from the city of Tours,
and within sight of the village of Roche-Corbon,
stood an old gray château, almost
buried in woods. The Revolution of ’92
had most effectually dispersed its former
owners, who surely in their wildest flight
of imagination never dreamt that their
venerable roof-tree would become one
day a boarding-school for the English
“Mees”—“Not a school,” Madame Daverne
affirmed, merely a few young friends, whose
education she undertook to superintend
for the consideration of three hundred
pounds per annum; and a very good investment
Madame found that old château,
and its rickety obsolete furniture. It is
true that she kept <i>char à banc</i> and
a pair of fat white horses for the use of
her young friends. How otherwise could
they go to Tours thrice a-week to receive
lessons in music, singing, painting, riding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
fencing, and dancing? How otherwise
attend the English church once a-day on
Sunday? But Jules and his horses were
not an expensive item—rent and living
were cheap; Madame was a manager, a
strict disciplinarian, and a most excellent
teacher.</p>

<p>The château at Rougemont was a delightful
place to its young English inmates,
entirely different to a great, formal, stiff
house at home, with so many rooms on
each floor, all the same size, and nothing
interesting or unusual from garret to cellar.
Here in the château, with its little pepper-castor
towers and corkscrew staircases, they
were constantly making some novel discovery,
whether of a secret panel, or a
secret stair, a well, a picture, or a grave.
It had even been hinted that an <i>oubliette</i>
was somewhere on the premises. Rougemont
far more resembled the Palace of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
the Sleeping Beauty, with its large kitchen
and hall, long stone passages and spacious
courtyard, than the orthodox establishment
for young ladies. It was surrounded
by a garden laid out in terraces, connected
by flights of shallow steps, and ornamented
with clipped yew-trees, closely resembling
in shape the toy-trees of the sheepfolds
of our youth, and a wonderful and varied
collection of stone, plaster, and even
coloured wooden statues, which burst upon
the eye in the most unlooked-for and
surprising manner.</p>

<p>Madame Daverne, the English widow
of a French <i>avocat</i>, was a little, thin,
middle-aged woman, invariably dressed in
gray, and never seen without her spectacles.
She wore her still abundant dark
hair in plain bandeaux—a long-exploded
fashion—and no cap. Although her
domestic arrangements were managed on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
a liberal English scale, and she believed
in plenty of cold water, open windows,
and <i>tea</i>, still she had lived sufficiently
long in the country of her adoption to
have imbibed a very strong prejudice in
favour of <i>surveillance</i>, especially as regarded
the young friends under her care.
No idle chatter about the boys at the Lycée,
of love, of lovers, was ever permitted;
novels and romances were unknown and
unread. The great outside world, with
its sayings and doings, was an unexplored
region to Madame Daverne’s pupils.
Nevertheless, her six young friends found
a good deal of happiness in each other’s
society; they spent a very busy, healthy
life—rambles in the forest, tennis, <i>la
grâce</i>, and gardening were their usual
amusements, and every Thursday during
summer and autumn they made expeditions
to Loches, Blois, Chinonceaux,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Plessis les Tours, Amboise, or other places
of, as Madame observed, “well-known
historical interest.”</p>

<p>More than six years had passed since
the wild little Irish imp had arrived at
Rougemont; and in those years what a
change had come over her! How marvellously
she had improved! Her gusts of
passion were among the things of the
past, her goat-like impulses had been
subdued, her craving to ride every horse
she met had long been curbed, her
ignorance—who dares to talk of ignorance
in connection with Madame Daverne’s
most brilliant and most accomplished
pupil?</p>

<p>Few girls take leave of school and
schoolfellows with as much regret as Alice
Saville. Rougemont has been her home,
and she has no desire to leave the shelter
of its gray walls and venture out into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
world alone among strangers. She loves
every stick and stone about the old place;
every feature in the landscape she looks
out on is a dear familiar friend; from
the “Lanterne” itself to venerable Marmoutier,
from Marmoutier to the Cathedral,
whence comes the <i>Angelus</i>, faintly
audible across the waters of the swiftly-rolling,
poplar-fringed Loire.</p>

<p>To-morrow Alice is to leave Rougemont
for ever. Miss Fane, her guardian’s
aunt, is at this instant in the city of
Tours. To-morrow she comes to fetch
her away; and no child at the zenith
of her enjoyment at a children’s party
ever heard the terrible words: “Your nurse
has come,” with a chillier thrill of dismay
than did Alice when Madame Daverne
announced to her that her future protector
was about to remove her from her
care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Alice and her friends are sitting on some
broken stone steps; she in the middle, of
course, for is not this their last evening
together? and are they not all very fond
of Alice, and very very sorry that she is
leaving them? They may well be fond
of Alice, for she is the brightest creature
that ever lived, and the life and soul of the
little community; a favourite with everyone,
from Madame herself down to an old lame
<i>femme de ménage</i> occasionally called in on
domestic emergencies. Who could sing,
and dance, and tell ghost-stories like her?
Who dressed up and acted with the inimitable
talent of their fair-haired schoolfellow?
Who was as generous, as unselfish, as ready
to help, to give, or to lend, as Alice?
Bright and gay, warm-hearted and clever,
all the inmates of Rougemont know that
when she departs she will leave a blank
behind her impossible to fill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Think of the prettiest girl you ever saw,
and it may give you some faint idea of
Alice Saville, as she sat on the topmost
step but one, with her hands locked round
her knees (an easy if not graceful attitude),
and her eyes gazing down on the valley
of the Loire for the last time. Had your
beauty mischievous violet eyes—eyes whose
colour was a mystery to many, owing to
their rapid change of expression and their
sweeping black lashes; quantities of golden-brown
wavy hair rippling and curling away
from her forehead, a roseleaf complexion,
a purely Grecian profile, and seventeen
summers?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The farewells have been said three months
ago; many tears were shed—and dried;
and now the curtain rises upon new scenes.
Touraine and its picturesque old châteaux
and dim green woods fades away, to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
place to the narrow, sun-scorched, steppy
streets of Valetta.</p>

<p>In a cool spacious apartment, overlooking
a Moorish courtyard, filled with
orange-trees in green tubs and various
semi-tropical plants, Alice and Miss Fane
are sitting reading. The post has just
come in, and Miss Fane is revelling in
an abundant supply of letters, which flutter
and rustle in an aggravating manner as the
cool sea-breeze steals in and plays with
them, and seems to try to snatch from
their recipient the full enjoyment of their
contents. The breeze plays tenderly and
lovingly with Alice Saville’s stray little
curls, but she reads on and takes no notice.
Nothing short of a “Levanter” would rouse
her from her study—“Ivanhoe.” The world
of fiction has been opened to her at last!
Miss Fane thinks that “there is no harm
in the Waverley novels, with the exception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
of the ‘Heart of Midlothian;’” <i>that</i> is
carefully put aside; any of the others Alice
may read; and Alice is rapidly devouring
them. Her crewel-work lies neglected
on the floor; her cup of tea stands at her
elbow untasted; and all her thoughts
are entirely engrossed in the storming of
Torquilstone Castle.</p>

<p>Miss Fane and Alice had spent the
autumn in visiting Rome, Florence, and
Nice, and were spending a few weeks in
Malta before returning to London, where
they were to reside together; and Alice
was to make her <i>début</i> the ensuing season.
She found Valetta altogether delightful.
Fresh from her studies, with the history
of the Crusades, and of the Knights of
Rhodes and Malta still green in her memory,
the half-mediæval half-oriental aspect of
the place fascinated her beyond measure.
Many an hour did she spend in the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Cathedral of St. John, endeavouring to
decipher the tombs with which its numerous
chapels are paved. Her knowledge of
French and Italian helped her to find
out the meaning of their Latin inscriptions,
and many and various were the stories she
mentally wove about those valiant, war-worn,
monkish soldiers lying beneath her
feet. “Exploring” was Alice’s favourite
recreation, as she was not, strictly speaking,
“out” as yet; and balls, dancelettes, and
yachting picnics were unknown pleasures.
The long narrow streets, the “Nix Mangiare”
stairs, the odd steep ascents, were
an amusing and delightful novelty to her
light active feet, but a sore detested pilgrimage
to Miss Fane’s gaunt old bones.
The mysterious little shops that line these
queer streets of stairs were another perennial
source of interest, including the sleek cats
that sat sentry in almost every doorway.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
The Maltese themselves were capital subjects
for sketches or study; whether they lay
flat on their backs, basking in the sun,
with their caps pulled over their faces, or
lounged in lazy groups about the corners
of picturesque old houses, or drove their
huge betasselled mules up and down the
steep stradas, they were ever and always
a fresh novelty to Alice. She little knew
that she herself outrivalled the “fried
monks” as one of the “sights of Malta;”
or that she was the object of general
interest and admiration, as, escorted by
her austere-looking chaperon, she roamed
about, satisfying the curiosity of youth and
the craving of a highly imaginative mind.</p>

<p>Miss Fane had been working steadily
through her correspondence. Long crossed
letters, resembling lattice-work, occupied her
for the best part of an hour. At length
she came to one in a bold, black, manly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
hand, not crossed, not even filling two
pages. She knit her brows more than once
as she perused it, then slowly folded it,
put it in its envelope, and fastened a look
that a basilisk might have envied, on her
companion.</p>

<p>Glancing up from her novel with a frank
fearless countenance, she encountered Miss
Fane’s cold gray eyes critically surveying
her, over the top of her tortoiseshell
pince-nez. To describe Miss Fane more
particularly, she was a prim, dignified,
elderly lady, seated bolt upright on the
most uncompromising chair in the room.
She had well-cut aristocratic features; a
high arrogant-looking nose; rather a spiteful
mouth; iron-gray sausage curls, carefully
arranged on either temple, and surmounted
by a sensibly sedate cap. A very handsome
brown silk dress, as stiff as herself,
completed her costume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>Not being overburdened with this
world’s goods, owing to the failure of a
bank in which most of her fortune had
been invested, she had accepted a very handsome
allowance and the post of chaperon
to her nephew’s ward. If she could have
had this immense increase to her income
without the ward, so much the better; girls
were not to her taste, but though narrow-minded,
frigid, and intensely selfish, she
was strictly conscientious, according to her
lights, and was thoroughly prepared to do
her duty by her young companion.</p>

<p>“Alice,” she said, glancing from Alice
to the note she held in her hand, and then
back again with an air of hesitation, “I
have just heard from my nephew, your
guardian, you know. He expects to leave
India immediately; and if the <i>Euphrates</i>
stops here for coaling, he says he will
come and look us up. Would you like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
read his letter? Perhaps I ought not to
show it to you; but it will give you
some idea of the kind of young man
he is.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” replied his ward, stretching
out a slim ready hand; “if you really
think I <i>may</i>, Miss Fane,” she added interrogatively,
whereupon Miss Fane handed
her her nephew’s effusion, which ran as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“Cheetapore.<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Aunt Mary,</span></p>

<p>“I got your last letter all right.
I did not answer it at once as I had
nothing to say, and am no scribe at the
best of times. I quite agree with you,
that you had much better take entire
charge of Miss Saville now she has
left school; but why not have kept
her there another year or two? Your
suggestion is excellent, and you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
make a much more fitting guardian than
my unworthy self. I do not know what
on earth I should have done with her if
you had not come to the rescue. I cannot
imagine what possessed my father to leave
me, of all people, guardian to a girl. Of
course I shall look after her money affairs,
etc., but I hope you will take her off my
hands completely. No doubt she will
marry soon, as you say she is pretty, and
if the <i>parti</i> is anything like a decent
fellow, and comes up to the mark in the
way of settlements, you may take my
consent for granted—I shall say: ‘Bless
you, my children,’ with unmixed satisfaction.
I am bringing you some shawls,
curios, etc., to make amends for my shortcomings
as a correspondent. We sail from
Bombay on the twenty-second, and if we
coal at Malta I shall look you up. What
in the world took you there? It strikes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
me you are becoming a regular ‘globetrotter’
in your old age.</p>

<p class="right">
“Your affectionate Nephew,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 0.5em;">“<span class="smcap">R. M. Fairfax</span>.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>“What a funny letter, or note rather!”
exclaimed Alice; “only two sides of the
paper. The Fifth Hussars have a very
pretty crest; and what a good hand he
writes! He certainly seems very anxious
to get rid of <i>me</i>, does he not, Miss Fane?
I am afraid I am a great infliction,” she
added, colouring, “but I will do my best
to trouble him as little as possible.”</p>

<p>“I will make you a much more suitable
guardian,” returned Miss Fane complacently.
“I do not know what my brother-in-law
could have been dreaming about
when he made his will. Poor man! he
naturally thought he had yet many years
to live, and never contemplated your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
having such a preposterously young guardian.
Reginald cares for nothing beyond
his profession—horses, racing, and men’s
society. My brother-in-law spoiled him as
a boy, and allowed him his own way completely,
though I believe he was a good
son and very much attached to his father.
Greville was a weak-minded man,” she
pursued, shaking her head reflectively,
“governed first by his wife and then by
his son. Reginald has always been his own
master, and is headstrong and overbearing
to the last degree.”</p>

<p>“You don’t like him, Miss Fane?”
inquired Alice, slightly raising her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Ah well!” hesitatingly, “I don’t
exactly say that; I have seen so little
of him since he was a boy; and then he
was, without exception, the most troublesome,
mischievous, impudent urchin I ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
came across; always in trouble, falling
out of trees, or downstairs, or off his
pony, playing practical jokes, fighting the
gardener’s big boys, riding his father’s
hunters on the sly. He kept everyone
in hot water. I spent six <i>months</i> at
Looton, and added six <i>years</i> to my
life,” concluded Miss Fane, nodding her
head with much solemnity.</p>

<p>The truth was, Miss Fane had gone to
Looton on a very long visit, with the
intention of remaining permanently as
virtual mistress. Her easy-going brother-in-law
would have made no objection, but
her impish nephew immediately saw through
her object, and made her life unbearable.
His practical jokes were chiefly at her expense,
and the way in which he teased
her beloved poodle was simply intolerable.
She had to give up her intention of remaining,
and leave what she had fully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
intended to have been a most luxurious
home.</p>

<p>This she had never forgotten, nor forgiven;
her feelings on the subject had
been stifled, but they smouldered. She
never cared for her nephew—never would;
he was far too like his mother—her handsome
stepsister—whom she had detested
with all her heart. Nevertheless, she found
it to her advantage to be on apparently
good terms with her liberal and wealthy
relative, who had not the remotest idea
of the real feelings his aunt secretly
cherished towards him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>About a week later the <i>Euphrates</i> came
into Malta, late one evening. Miss Fane
and the Lee-Dormers were dining at the
Governor’s; Alice, not being “out,” had
tea <i>solus</i> at home.</p>

<p>Time hung heavily on her hands; her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
book was stupid, she was not in the
humour for music, and it was too early
to go to bed. Opening the window, she
stepped out on the balcony that ran all
round the house and overlooked the courtyard.
Here she remained for a long time,
her chin resting on her hand, indulging
in a day-dream—“in maiden meditation,
fancy free.” The air was laden with the
perfume of twenty different flowers; but
the fragrant orange-trees in their tubs
down below overpowered all.</p>

<p>“How delicious!” said Alice to herself,
sniffing the air. “If I am ever married—which
is not very likely—I shall have a
wreath of real orange-blossoms, always
supposing I can get them.”</p>

<p>Presently she turned her attention to
the stars, and endeavoured to make out
some of the constellations, not very
successfully, it must be confessed. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
listened to the distant driving through
Valetta.</p>

<p>“Belated sightseers returning to their
steamers,” she thought.</p>

<p>Just then a carriage drove rapidly into
their quiet street, and seemed to stop
close by.</p>

<p>“It can’t be Miss Fane come home
already; they are barely at coffee yet,”
she mentally remarked, as she settled herself
for another reverie.</p>

<p>After a while, feeling rather chilly, she
pushed open the window and stepped back
into the sitting-room. For a moment the
light dazzled her eyes. That moment
past, what was her amazement to find a
handsome young man, in undress cavalry
uniform, standing on the rug with his
back to the fire!</p>

<p>The surprise was apparently mutual.
However, he at once came forward and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Saville, I am sure. The servant
said my aunt was out, but that you were
at home. As the room was empty, I
concluded you had gone to bed.”</p>

<p>“When did you arrive?” she asked,
offering her hand.</p>

<p>“We came in about two hours ago,
and are going to coal all night—a most
detestable but necessary performance.”</p>

<p>“Have you been here long?” was her
next question, as she seated herself near
the table.</p>

<p>“About twenty minutes. I have been
enjoying this English-looking fire immensely.
You must have found it rather
chilly in the verandah, I should say.”</p>

<p>A thought flitted through his mind—“Was
there a Romeo to this lovely
Juliet?” He looked down at her with
a quick keen glance. No; the idea was
absurd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“What were you doing out there this
cool evening?” he added.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she replied shyly. She
could not bring herself to tell this brilliant
stranger that she had been simply
star-gazing.</p>

<p>“A regular bread-and-butter miss,” he
thought, as he pulled his moustache with
a leisurely patronising look.</p>

<p>Bread-and-butter or not, she was an
extremely pretty girl, and his ward. The
idea tickled him immensely. He put his
hand before his mouth to conceal an
involuntary smile.</p>

<p>“Vernon or Harcourt would give a good
deal to be in my shoes, I fancy,” he said
to himself, as he took a seat at the opposite
side of the table from his charge.</p>

<p>Alice having mastered her first astonishment,
felt that it behoved her to make
some attempt at conversation, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
endeavour to entertain this unexpected
guest, pending Miss Fane’s return. She
offered him refreshments, coffee, etc., which
he declined, having dined previously to
coming on shore. With small-talk, Maltese
curios, and the never-failing topic—weather,
she managed to while away the time. At
first her voice was very low, as it always
was when she was nervous or embarrassed,
but she soon recovered herself, and played
the part of hostess in a manner that
astonished the man who, half-an-hour
before, had called her (mentally) “a
bread-and-butter miss.” Seven years on
the Continent had given her at least
easy polished manners. She had none of
the <i>gaucherie</i> so common to an English
girl of her own age, brought up exclusively
at home. It seemed to her that
Sir Reginald was <i>shy!</i>—he sat opposite
to her playing with a paperknife, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
by no means properly supporting his share
of the conversation. Her good-natured
efforts amused him prodigiously. He was
sufficiently sharp to see that she thought
him bashful and diffident, whereas he was
only lazy; he preferred to allow ladies,
whenever they were good enough to talk
to him, to carry on the most of the conversation,
a few monosyllables, and his
eloquent dark eyes, contributing his share.
Poor deluded Alice! she little knew that
the apparently diffident young man was
the life and soul of his mess, and that
shyness was unknown to him (except by
name) since he had been out of his
nurse’s arms.</p>

<p>Conversation presently became somewhat
brisker; they exchanged experiences
of Germany and India. They discussed
books, horses, and music, and at the end
of an hour Alice felt as if she had known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
him for at least a year. Certainly they
had made as much progress in each
other’s confidence as if they had gone
through a London season together, when
a few brief utterances are gasped between
the pauses in a waltz, or whispered on
the stairs, or interrupted by some spoil-sport
in the Row.</p>

<p>As for Reginald, he not only felt completely
at home, but, what was worse,
most thoroughly bewitched.</p>

<p>“I’m never going to be so mad as to
lose my head about this grown-up child,
am I?” he indignantly asked himself. “I
who have hitherto been invulnerable, as far
as the tender passion is concerned. No!
not likely. If I can’t face a pretty girl
without immediately feeling smitten, the
sooner I renounce the whole sex the
better.”</p>

<p>Whilst he was thinking thus, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
to all appearance immersed in a series
of views of Rome and Florence, and
listening to a description of palaces,
churches, and tombs.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest <i>soupçon</i>
of a flirtation between this couple. Sir
Reginald talked to his ward as he would
to his grandmother, and there was a look
in her clear deep gray eyes that would
have abashed the most thorough-paced
male flirt in Christendom—which he was
very far from being—a look half of
childish innocence, half of newly-awakened
maiden dignity—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Miss Fane duly returned, and accorded
her nephew a warm welcome and a kiss,
which he very reluctantly received, for
she had also a <i>moustache</i>! She treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
him besides to a most <i>recherché</i> little
supper, and at twelve o’clock he took his
departure, faithfully promising to look
them out a suitable house in London, and
with an uneasy conviction that he had
met his fate.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I need scarcely tell the astute reader
that the acquaintance thus formed shortly
ripened into something else: a few dances—a
few rides in the Row—a water-party—the
Cup-day at Ascot—finally a moonlight
picnic, and the thing was settled.</p>

<p>Before the end of the season the
following announcement appeared in <i>The
Times</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the 25th inst., at St. George’s,
Hanover Square, by the Lord Bishop of
Bermuda, assisted by the Rev. H. Fane,
Sir Reginald Mostyn Fairfax, Bart.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
Captain Fifth Hussars, of Looton Park,
Bordershire, to Alice Eveleen, only child
of the late Major-General Saville.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Reginald expressed his intention of
retiring, much to the disgust of his
brother-officers, who said they thought
Fairfax was the last man who would
have married and left them. “You of
all people too! After the way you used
to be down on other fellows who fell in
love, or got married—it’s perfectly shameful!
You were actually the means of
nipping several very promising affairs in
the bud, and now you are going to get
married yourself. What excuse have you
to make?” cried an indignant hussar.</p>

<p>“I say,” replied Sir Reginald complacently,
“‘that he jests at scars who never felt a
wound.’ That was my case. Now I’m a
reformed character.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>But when at the drawing-room, the opera,
and elsewhere, the Fifth saw the future
Lady Fairfax, even the most hardened
bachelor among them frankly admitted that
“Rex,” as they called him, had a very fair
excuse.</p>

<p>After their honeymoon the Fairfaxes went
down to Looton, where they were considered
the handsomest and happiest couple
within three counties.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br><span class="small">LOOTON PARK.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Looton is a large, ugly, uncomfortable old
place, similar to hundreds of others scattered
over the British isles. No one knows
exactly when it was built, but everyone is
aware that it is surrounded by the very
best land in Bordershire. The house stands
in a large well-timbered park, and is approached
by two avenues from opposite
directions.</p>

<p>Seated at the library-table, with his
elbows well squared, a young man of
about one-and-twenty is dashing off a letter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
He is Geoffrey Saville, first cousin to Lady
Fairfax, and has lately joined the Fifth
Hussars—so lately that he is still doing
riding-school, from which a fortnight’s visit
to Looton has afforded him temporary
emancipation.</p>

<p>He is a slim, bright-eyed, loose-limbed
boy, with small impudent hazel eyes, an
aristocratic nose, and light-brown hair, of
which one utterly unreasonable lock always
sticks up on the top of his head, cut, and
comb, and oil as he will. He is possessed
of the highest of spirits, the best of
appetites, and unlimited assurance. He is
gay, gentlemanly, and generous, and swears
by his new cousin, but old friend, Sir
Reginald Fairfax.</p>

<p>Here is his letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Nobbs</span>,</p>

<p>“I promised to send you a line to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
let you know how I was getting on. Rex
and Alice make no end of a good host and
hostess; the feeding is superior, and as
to horses, I am ‘all found.’ Rex mounts
me as he mounts himself, and I take it
out of his cattle fairly.</p>

<p>“We have had two or three good runs
with the R. B. H. and Overstones, especially
last Tuesday; found at Heplow—(you don’t
know where that is, but never mind)—and
ran to Clumber, a distance of eight miles
as the crow flies, with only one slight
check. The pace was prime, the grief
awful. The fields were large and airy, but
some of the fences, notably the bullfinches,
were real raspers. The finish was highly
select—Alice, Reginald, two cavalry men,
a parson, the huntsman, and yours obediently.
Alice goes like a bird; and in
a neat double-breasted brown habit and pot-hat
to match, and mounted on a clipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
bay thoroughbred, looks very ‘fit’ indeed.
Rex pilots her, and they make a very fair
average example of the field. You know
what a customer he is. She follows him as
if she had a spare neck in her pocket, and
charges wood and water as boldly as he
does himself.</p>

<p>“Talking of water, there is a brute of
a river here, called the Swale, which
winds about in the most mysterious manner.
You come across it when you least expect
it. I have already been in twice! I paid
my second visit last Friday. I was steaming
along close to the pack, when what
should I see in front of me but this sneak
of a river. I rammed in the spurs, and
thundered down to it as hard as I could
go, but I had already bucketed the old
horse too freely: he bore down as if he
meant business, stopped short, and shot
me over his head into about seven feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of muddy water. I’ll leave you to imagine
the figure I was when I picked myself out!</p>

<p>“I created a fine sensation all along the
Queen’s highway <i>en route</i> home. Alice
and Reginald have never stopped chaffing
me ever since. You ask me how he plays
the <i>rôle</i> of married man? Capitally, my
dear fellow; and as to your unkind insinuation
that I must be rather in the
way, considering they are so recently married,
you never were more mistaken in
your life. They are not a bit a spooney
couple; at least I never see any billing
or cooing, thank goodness, and I favour
them with a good deal of my society; but
anyone can see with half an eye that each
thinks the other perfection, and that they
suit down to the ground. He has got a
fortnight’s domestic privilege leave to go
and see poor Maitland of the Blues, who
is dying at Cannes; they were great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
chums always, and at Eton together.
Meanwhile I remain here and help old
Miss Fane (a bitter specimen of the unappropriated
blessing) to take care of the
fair châtelaine; and as I am to exercise
the hunters, and have the run of the
stable, I am promising myself five days
a week between the two packs, and the
very cream of hunting. I wish you would
go to Thomas and hurry him with my
tops, and run me in for another fortnight’s
leave, as enclosed. If the chief looks
grumpy, say I have broken my collarbone.
I’ll do as much for you another
time.</p>

</div>


<p>Sir Reginald left for Cannes the end of
November, intending to spend a week
there, and to be home, of course, long
before Christmas. Meanwhile, a plot he
little dreamt of had been hatched for his
benefit. A storm was brewing; in fact,
a regular cyclone threatened his domestic
atmosphere.</p>

<p>When he was in India with the Fifth
Hussars, among his few lady acquaintances
outside the regiment there was one
who had taken an immense fancy to him—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
fancy he by no means reciprocated.
She was the daughter of an old Commissariat
officer, who had survived to enjoy
his off-reckonings and settled down at
Cheetapore. “After thirty-eight years of
India, he could not stand England,” he
said; “one winter there would finish
him.”</p>

<p>Miss Mason had been already four
seasons on the plains. The climate was
beginning to tarnish her beauty—the dark
Italian style, her friends declared. Her
foes, on the other hand, did not scruple
to accuse her of “four annas in the
rupee”—native blood, in fact. She was,
nevertheless, one of the belles of the
station. Time was flying, as I have said
before, her good looks were waning, and
she was becoming extremely anxious to
be settled. Fully determined to marry
well, thoroughly bold and unscrupulous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and believing firmly in Thackeray’s dictum,
“that any woman who has not positively
a hump can marry any man she pleases,”
she looked about her, to see whom she would
have.</p>

<p>One of the Fifth Hussars for choice; they
were mostly well-born, and all rich. After
some hesitation, she made up her mind
that Captain Fairfax (as he then was) was
perhaps the most desirable of the lot. A
future baronet, of distinguished appearance,
young, rich, and extremely popular, what
more could she wish for? Not much,
indeed.</p>

<p>But he rarely mixed in ladies’ society;
and there was a certain <i>hauteur</i> about
him—a kind of “touch-me-not” air—that
inclined her to think he might give her
some trouble. But then he was worth it.
How good-looking he was—his keen dark
eyes, regular features, and thick moustache,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
together with his slight well-knit figure,
quite fulfilled her beau-ideal of a handsome,
gallant hussar.</p>

<p>So she prepared to lay siege to him,
and at once commenced to bring her heavy
guns into action. But it was in vain—all
in vain. It was useless to waylay him
in the ride of a morning; with a hurried
bow he cantered on. It was equally futile
to get a friendly chaperon to escort her
to cavalry parades on Wednesday mornings,
for after drill he invariably went off
to stables. Polo, at which he was a great
performer, was also a blank, as whenever
it was over, instead of lounging and talking
to the lady spectators, he mounted his
hack and disappeared. At the races she
was more successful, and began to think
she was making way at last. The Hussars
had a tent, and, being one of the hosts,
Sir Reginald was brought in contact with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
her repeatedly. But what she attributed
to special attention was merely the courtesy
with which he treated all the sex.</p>

<p>At balls she danced with him several
times; but she could see that he much
preferred dancing to talking, and grudged
every moment that she wasted in conversation.
However, “Rome was not built
in a day.” “Patience,” she thought, “and
I shall be Lady Fairfax yet. He is no
flirt, and does not devote himself to any
lady here, married or single. All this is
a point in <i>my</i> favour,” she reflected. “He
only wants drawing out; he is reserved
and cold, but never fear, I shall thaw
him.” She invited him repeatedly to her
father’s house, invitations which he steadily
and politely declined, and still not discouraged,
made a point of stopping and
accosting him wherever they met, were
it on the road, coming out of church, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
at the band. She endeavoured to arrange
playful bets on trifling subjects, and made
frequent allusions to the language of
flowers; forced button-holes on him, and
finally calling him to her carriage as he
was riding past at the band, one evening—it
was dark, and he fondly hoped to disappear
unnoticed—she entreated him to
dismount and have a chat.</p>

<p>“I cannot—very many thanks—as this
is guest-night, and I have some fellows
coming to dinner, and it is now”—looking
at his watch—“a quarter to seven.”</p>

<p>“And what of that?” she returned
playfully; “surely you can spare <i>me</i> a
few minutes?”</p>

<p>Dead silence, during which her victim
was revolving in his brain his chances of
escape.</p>

<p>“Have you any sisters, Captain Fairfax?”
she inquired, apropos of nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“No; I wish I had.”</p>

<p>“You would be very fond of them, I
am sure”—effusively.</p>

<p>“I daresay I would.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” she exclaimed, leaning over and
patting his horse’s back caressingly, and
looking up into his face with her bold
black eyes—“ah, Captain Fairfax, how I
should like to be your sister!”</p>

<p>With an imperceptible shudder he replied
in his most frosty tone:</p>

<p>“You do me far too much honour, Miss
Mason.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” she said impressively;
“<i>nothing</i> is too good for you, in my
opinion.”</p>

<p>“You are very kind to say so, I am
sure,” he replied, much embarrassed. “I
must really be off,” gathering up his reins.</p>

<p>“Stay, stay—one second,” she entreated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
“You remember the cracker we pulled together
at the General’s on Monday, and I
would not show you the motto? I was
ashamed.”</p>

<p>“No doubt you were; some wretched,
vulgar rubbish”—preparing to depart.</p>

<p>“No, no, not that,” she cried eagerly,
“only—only—you will understand all
when I give it to you—when <i>I</i> give it
to <i>you</i>, you understand. I know you
will not think it either wretched or vulgar
when you read it. Do not look at it till
you get home and are quite—quite <i>alone</i>,”
she added, pressing an envelope into his
most reluctant hand.</p>

<p>“All right,” he replied, taking off his
hat and rapidly riding away, only too glad
to escape.</p>

<p>In the privacy of his own room he
opened the mysterious envelope, and held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
its contents—a narrow slip of paper—to
the lamp. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My hand, my heart, my life, are thine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thy hand, thy heart, thy life, are mine.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Not that I know of,” he exclaimed
fiercely, and colouring to the roots of his
hair. “The woman must be insane,” he
muttered, tearing the motto into fragments
and scattering them on the floor. “She
could not really think I cared two straws
about her. If it is a joke, as of course it
is,” he proceeded, “it is by no means a
nice one, or one that a thoroughly lady-like
girl would ever dream of practising.
If she <i>were</i> my sister,” he continued, with
a grim smile, “I would give her a piece
of my mind that would astonish her weak
nerves. God forbid she was any relation
to me!” he added fervently. “I’ll give her
an uncommonly wide berth for the future.”</p>

<p>This mental resolve of his was most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
rigidly carried out. He avoided Miss Mason
in an unmistakable manner, and held aloof
from society on her account. It took her
some time to realise this painful fact, but
when she did grasp it her whole soul rose
in arms; and hearing about the same period
a remark he had made about her—viz.
“that she might be considered a fine-looking
woman, but was not at all his style,
and that he thought her awfully bad form.”
This, though breathed in confidence over
a midnight cheroot, <i>en route</i> from a dance
where Miss Mason had been making herself
more than usually conspicuous—came round
to her ears, and acted like a match in gunpowder,
oil in flame. The most venomous
hatred took the place of her former
admiration, and an insatiate craving for
revenge filled her fair bosom—a revenge
she fully determined to gratify on the
earliest possible occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>Time went on, the Hussars left for
England, and the wedding of Alice and
Reginald found its way into the <i>Home
News</i>. “Now,” thought she, “I will have
my innings. I will drop a shell into his
camp that will astonish him, to say the
least of it, and I’ll light the match at
once.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Mason’s dearest friend and inveterate
ally was spending the day with her.
It was October, and although the hot
weather was a thing of the past, yet it was
still warm, and occasionally muggy. Tiffin
concluded, the two ladies retired, Indian
fashion, to Miss Mason’s room, and there
donned cool white dressing-gowns, and
subsided into long cane-lounges. For
some time the monotonous creaking of
the punkah-rope alone broke the silence.</p>

<p>Presently Miss Mason said: “Harriet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Chambers, I have been a good friend to
you. Have I not stood by you through
thick and thin, and helped you out of one
or two nasty scrapes?”</p>

<p>“You have indeed, dear Charlotte,”
replied Mrs. Chambers in grateful accents,
and with a visibly heightened colour.</p>

<p>“Well now, I want you to do something
for me—only a trifle after all, but still I
would rather trust you than anyone.”</p>

<p>“What can I do? Whatever it is, I shall
be only too glad,” returned Mrs. Chambers
effusively.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, I’ll soon tell you. You
recollect Captain Fairfax of the Hussars?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course I do; a dark young man,
who won the Arconum cup, and spent all
his time out shikarring.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! but he found time enough to
be very rude to me and I wish to pay him
off somehow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“But what did he do?” asked Mrs.
Chambers, her curiosity aroused.</p>

<p>“Never mind what he did—he treated me
shamefully, cruelly, abominably,” returned
Miss Mason with venomous <i>empressement</i>
and a noble indifference to facts.</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate, he has left the country
now,” put in Mrs. Chambers soothingly.</p>

<p>“But a letter can always reach him. I
know his address at home. He is just
married, and I was thinking of giving them
a little bone of contention to amuse themselves
with—something to ruffle up the
dead, flat monotony of the honeymoon. For
instance, a sham marriage certificate would
give her a good fright.”</p>

<p>“Oh! but, my dear Charlotte,” gasped
her friend, raising herself to a sitting
posture, “you are joking. You would not
think of such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Would I not?” replied Charlotte, with
an unpleasant laugh and shake of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
head. “I have thought of it, and, what is
more, I mean to do it.”</p>

<p>“But you might cause fearful mischief;
and, besides, I am sure it’s forgery,”
Mrs. Chambers added with an awe-struck
voice.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” said Miss Mason
lightly. “I have laid all my plans. Listen,”
she continued, sitting up. “Oh, bother
these mosquitoes,” waving her handkerchief
to and fro. “Now attend to me. You
know the clerk of All Saints’, a stupid,
drunken old wretch, who would sell his
soul for ten rupees. I have bribed him to
let me have the church register and a lot
of spare printed copies of certificates—blank
forms, you know. I pretend I want to look
out something for a friend. He brought
the register here this morning, and I am to
have it ready for him when he calls after
dark; for, although there are very few
weddings—more’s the pity—and no one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
troubles about the register at All Saints’,
yet such books are not supposed to go
travelling about in this style. Here it is,”
and from beneath the mattress of her bed
she produced a thick calf-bound volume.
“Here are the printed forms,” she continued,
getting up and busying herself
arranging a writing-table, which she pushed
towards her friend, whose eyes followed her
movements in dumb amazement. “Now,”
she said, “Harriet, you are to copy a certificate
of marriage on one of these blank
strips, do you see.”</p>

<p>“I!” cried Mrs. Chambers. “Good
heavens, Charlotte, you are out of your
mind! It would be downright forgery.
You are mad to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Forgery! Folly—it’s only a joke.
After the first glance, no woman in her
senses would see it in any other light. It’s
a joke, I tell you—a <i>joke</i>, and I know,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
added, looking her friend straight in the
face, “that for several <i>reasons</i> you will not
refuse me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but really—really,” faltered her
victim.</p>

<p>“Yes, but really you will do it. Do you
think I would ask you to do anything that
was not right—that was illegal? Come,
come, Harriet, here is a chair. You imitate
writing so splendidly, you will have to
oblige me, and I’ll give you my gold swami
earrings into the bargain, besides all the
good offices I have already done for
you.”</p>

<p>Finding herself in the presence of a
vigorous will, Mrs. Chambers, who was
weak-minded and indolent, eventually succumbed,
and very reluctantly settled to
her task. The last marriage certificate was
used as a copy, and splendidly imitated by
Mrs. Chambers; the name of Reginald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
Fairfax was substituted for the man, and
Fanny Cole for the spinster. The witnesses’
and the clergyman’s signatures were added.
The only name that was really forged was
the clergyman’s: “A correct copy of certificate
of marriage as signed and attested
by me.—<span class="smcap">Hugh Parry.</span>”</p>

<p>This was a facsimile; the remaining
part of the certificate was in a round
clerkly hand, as if copied by that functionary.
It was finished, and, villanous
document as it was, was in every respect
to all appearance an authorised and legal
copy of a certificate of marriage.</p>

<p>Miss Mason having quieted her friend’s
scruples by assuring her over and over
again that it was “only a joke,” and
having refreshed her with five-o’clock tea
and half a brandy-and-soda, and sworn
her to profoundest secrecy, dismissed her
tool with much affectionate demonstration.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
She then locked up the book and papers
and went for a drive, with the calm conviction
that she had done a good afternoon’s
work. The following day an anonymous
letter containing the mock certificate was
despatched to Lady Fairfax.</p>

<p>I should here mention that when the
old clerk called for the register and his
ten rupees, and got them, he hastened to
the Bazaar and laid in a fine supply of
arrack, which he conveyed to his solitary
“go down.” His orgie was on such an
extensive scale that when he upset a
lighted kerosine lamp he was perfectly
incapable of stirring or extinguishing it,
so he and his house and the marriage
register were all consumed together. This
occurrence was related to Miss Mason a
few evenings afterwards at the band, as
one of the items of local “gup;” also
that the church register was missing—had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
recently and mysteriously disappeared;
and that the general belief was that the
defunct clerk had made away with it.</p>

<p>Miss Mason received the intelligence as
a polite but totally disinterested listener;
but as she rolled along the dusty roads in
her carriage, on her way home, she thought
all the time of her little joke and its
probable consequences.</p>

<p>“‘Sweet is revenge, especially to women.’
I forget who wrote that; but it’s true,”
she murmured. “Mine is even more complete
than I had expected. Mr. Parry is
dead; the clerk and the register burnt;
the witnesses, John and Jane Fox, gone
to Australia nearly two years ago. Clear
yourself if you can, Sir Reginald Fairfax;
I’ll not help you; and I think you will
find that I have given you a difficult
task.”</p>

<p>Such were Miss Mason’s reflections, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
her amiability for the next two or three
days was as surprising as it was unbounded.
Occasionally she would lean
back in her low capacious Singapore chair,
drop her book in her lap, and indulge in
a long and evidently delightful reverie, bewildering
her foolish old father by sundry
fits of wholly unexplained suppressed
laughter.</p>

<p>“What ails you, Charlotte, my girl?
What’s the matter?” he asked once,
somewhat timidly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing. Nothing that would interest
you, daddy; only a little bit of
a practical joke that I have played on
somebody.”</p>

<p>Alice, Miss Fane, and Geoffrey were seated
at the breakfast-table one drizzling December
morning. The post had just come in.
Geoffrey, having unlocked the bag, was
distributing the letters.</p>

<p>“One for you, Miss Fane; looks like a
bill,” said he mischievously. “Two young-lady
letters for you, Alice, and one from
Fairfax, of course. I wonder he does not
write thrice a day, and telegraph at intervals:
‘How are you, my darling? Are you
thinking of me, my treasure?’ What will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
you give for it? It’s a pretty thick one,”
feeling it critically. “See what it is to
be a bride,” and he chanted:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They were never weary; they seemed each day</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Fresh ecstasy to imbibe;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And they gazed in each other’s eyes in a way</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That I really can’t describe.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And once it was my lot to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">What shocked my sensitive taste:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They were sitting as close as wax, and he</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Had his arm about her waist.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That you never did, you rude boy.
Here, give me my letter at once, sir!”
cried Alice, half rising.</p>

<p>“Madam, take it. You need not be
blushing like that; it makes me quite hot
to look at you. After all, you never did
shock my sensitive taste as yet, and I hope
you never will. Now for the newspapers,”
diving again into the bag. “Halloa!
here’s another letter, Alice—from India,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
I declare, and a good fat one too. Who
is your correspondent—a former disconsolate
admirer, writing from the East to
upbraid you with your perfidy?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Geoff; how can you talk
such utter rubbish? I’m sure I don’t know
who it can be from,” turning the letter
over. “Cheetapore! I know no one
there.”</p>

<p>“Well, look sharp and open it, and
you’ll soon see. Most likely a bill of
Reginald’s. I thought he was a ready-money
man,” said Geoffrey austerely.</p>

<p>Alice cut the envelope cautiously, and
drew out a thin note and a long slip of
paper. The note ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p>“The enclosed will show you that
Sir Reginald Fairfax is not <i>your</i> husband.
He has deceived you as he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
deceived others. His quiet exterior conceals
his real disposition. He is a wolf
in sheep’s clothing.</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">One who knows him well.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Greatly bewildered, and with trembling
hands, Alice unfolded the enclosure, and
gazed at it for some time before she exactly
understood what she was looking at.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Copy of Certificate of Marriage, All Saints’ Church,
Cheetapore.</p>

<p class="center">
Reginald Mostyn Fairfax, Bachelor—Fanny Cole, Spinster.<br>
Hugh Parry, Clerk.<br>
Marie Fox and John Fox, Witnesses.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>White as a sheet, and trembling like a
leaf, Alice handed this, along with the
letter, to Miss Fane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“What does it mean, Miss Fane?” she
asked, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>Miss Fane, having adjusted her pince-nez
carefully, took both and read them, and
as she read her countenance changed from
purple to yellow, from yellow to purple,
Alice meanwhile devouring her with her
eyes.</p>

<p>“I cannot make it out,” she said at last.
“It seems to be a perfectly correct copy
of a certificate of marriage, does it not,
Geoffrey?”</p>

<p>Geoffrey stretched out a ready hand
for the letter and certificate; but the first
glance at the letter had the same appalling
effect on him as on the two ladies. After
a dead silence, during which the ticking
of the clock and falling of the cinders
were distinctly audible, he plucked up
courage to say:</p>

<p>“A hoax, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>“How are we to know that?” asked
Miss Fane, drawing herself up.</p>

<p>“I’ll take it up to London and show
it to some first-rate solicitor and ask his
opinion; it’s only four hours by rail. Will
that do?” pushing back his chair and
looking at Alice interrogatively.</p>

<p>“Yes, do, my dear Geoff; and go at
once,” she cried eagerly; “for though I
know it is a ridiculous mistake, still I
feel quite odd and frightened. But perhaps,”
she added, after a moment’s pause, “we
should wait till Reginald comes home the
day after to-morrow; he will clear it up.
Yes, second thoughts are best; we will
wait, thank you, Geoff, all the same.”</p>

<p>“No, no, my dear!” said Miss Fane,
emphatically, “the sooner the matter is
cleared up the better. I must beg you to
take my advice on the subject as a person
much older and more experienced than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
either of you. Geoffrey can easily catch
the ten-o’clock train. It is now,” looking
at the clock, “a quarter-past nine.”</p>

<p>After a short discussion, during which
the elder lady carried all before her, it
was settled that Geoffrey was to start at
once; so he quickly bolted his breakfast,
and within half-an-hour was speeding up
to London as fast as an express could
take him. Thinking it better to consult
some older head, he drove from Waterloo
Station to Wessex Gardens, where Mr. and
Mrs. Mayhew, Sir Reginald’s first cousins,
lived. The Honorable Mark and his wife
were at luncheon when Geoffrey entered,
and without any beating about the bush
bluntly told his errand. They examined
the certificate with the greatest incredulity,
and laughed at the idea of “Rex” of all
people committing bigamy, “he so upright,
so honourable, a man of stainless character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
who had never been known to make a
love affair in his life till he met Alice,”
they chimed alternately. “The idea was
really too absurd; they wondered Geoffrey
could lend himself to such a wild-goose
chase.” Nevertheless there was the certificate,
“and just to show that it is a
forgery and to relieve Miss Fane’s mind,
you and Geoff will take it to some respectable
solicitors and quietly ask their opinion,”
said Mr. Mayhew. So they took it to
Bagge and Keepe, an intensely correct firm;
and Mr. Bagge, after carefully scrutinising
the certificate for some seconds, unhesitatingly
pronounced it to be a genuine copy,
and swore to the handwriting of the Rev.
Hugh Parry, who had been one of their
clients for years. “I can show you any
number of his letters, and you can judge
for yourselves, gentlemen,” he added, preparing
to open a brown japanned box, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
which “R. and H. Parry” was emblazoned
in large white characters.</p>

<p>The little hatchet-faced lawyer, with his
penetrating gray eyes and mutton-chop
whiskers, seemed so perfectly confident of
the identity of the signature and the truth
of the certificate, that Mr. Mayhew’s breath
was, metaphorically speaking, quite taken
away, and he gazed from him to Geoffrey—whose
visage had visibly lengthened—with
an air of utter stupefaction. His moral
equilibrium was completely shaken, as he
glanced from Mr. Bagge to the deed-box,
from the deed-box to Geoffrey, from
Geoffrey to the long slip of white paper—the
cause of all the mischief—that lay on
the green baize table before his eyes. He
pushed his hat well to the back of his head,
scratched his grizzly locks, and obviously
obtained some kind of mental inspiration,
for at last he found words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“It is of no consequence at present,
Mr. Bagge. I’m much obliged to you all
the same. And—a—you are quite certain
of this”—flourishing the certificate—“being
Mr. Parry’s signature?”</p>

<p>“Quite certain. You can compare it
yourself. Hancock,”—to a clerk—“just
reach down——”</p>

<p>“Never mind—not to-day—another time.
Thank you; a—good morning. Come along,
Geoffrey,” said the Honorable Mark, backing
himself through a swing-door, and
effecting his exit with extraordinary promptitude,
leaving Mr. Bagge under an impression
that he had been visited by a
gentleman who ought to be carefully looked
after by his friends, if not immediately
consigned to a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>“It is a queer business, Geoff,” exclaimed
Mr. Mayhew, once they found themselves
in the street, “a very queer business!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
striding along at a tremendous pace, and
looking very red in the face; “but Reginald’s
sure to make it all right, you may
take your oath of that. Just leave it to
him to settle. He’ll be back in a couple
of days. Mind you don’t miss the train—it’s
now a quarter-past five. Here’s a
hansom. Hop in, or you’ll be late. Give
Alice my love, and tell her it’s all right;
it will be all cleared up when Rex comes
home. Waterloo,” to the driver.</p>

<p>“All very fine,” muttered Geoffrey to
himself as he was rattled over the pavement;
“I wish he had to face Miss Fane,
with Bagge’s opinion, instead of me. She’ll
get it out of me before she sleeps to-night,
so I suppose I had better make a virtue of
necessity and tell the truth at once. Won’t
she just make a row!”</p>

<p>Alice having despatched Geoffrey, and
seen him fairly off to the station, as fast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
as the fastest harness hack could take him,
went up to her own room, and there read
her husband’s letter, from which her attention
had been so rudely diverted. It was a
nice letter for a young wife to get—not
a spooney, love-lorn effusion, but a good,
rational, amusing letter, that had evidently
given as much pleasure to the writer to
write as to Alice to receive, and that, without
fulsome extravagance, breathed a spirit of
true, proud, tender love from the first page
to the last. Till now, yesterday’s had been
to Alice the best and most precious of
letters; now to-day’s came to put it aside,
and would in turn give place to to-morrow’s,
for the last was always the most
prized.</p>

<p>Having read and re-read her letter, Alice
felt a double reliance on her husband and
a sovereign contempt for the marriage certificate,
which must be either someone else’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
or intended for a shameful hoax. Much
emboldened and encouraged by these reflections,
Alice ran downstairs in search
of Miss Fane, whom she found knitting
in the morning-room, with an ominous
purse on her lips and a frown on her
brow.</p>

<p>She was sitting in the window, and
merely raised her eyes for a second as
Alice entered. Alice approached her, and,
leaning against the window—with one hand
in her pocket surreptitiously grasping her
precious letter—plunged boldly into conversation.</p>

<p>“Miss Fane, I want to talk to you about
this dreadful certificate. What do you
think about it? For my own part, I most
certainly will never believe that Reginald
was ever married to anyone but me. It
is some excessively bad joke that he and
I will be laughing over together before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the end of the week. Don’t you think
so?”</p>

<p>“My dear, if you have fully made up
your mind, why ask me?” returned Miss
Fane coldly.</p>

<p>“Because I have no one else to talk
to about it. You are his aunt—his
mother’s sister. You would not believe
such a thing of him, I know.”</p>

<p>Miss Fane drew in her lips and knitted
faster and more fiercely than ever.</p>

<p>Alice, kneeling beside her, softly laid
her hand on her arm and said: “You
know I have no mother to advise me, or
think for me; and I am so dreadfully
young, and foolish, even for my age.
Don’t you think, if my mother were alive,
she would say, ‘Trust your husband?’ In
my heart I do sincerely trust him. Don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Miss Fane; and then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
after a pause, added: “That is to say,
as much as <i>any</i> young man can be trusted.
His mother was certainly my sister, but
we were very little together, as I lived
chiefly at my grandfather’s. She was a
handsome headstrong girl. Reginald has
his mother’s eyes and his mother’s temper,
or I am much mistaken. You would not
have found her very easy to get on with,
had she been spared,” observed Miss Fane
charitably; “but she died, poor thing,
when she was two-and-twenty. My brother-in-law
was inconsolable; he adored her, and
spoiled her, and did the same for her son.”</p>

<p>“Do not say that, Miss Fane. If
Reginald had been spoiled he could never
have grown up as he has done—so good,
so honourable, so——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” interrupted Miss Fane
irritably. “All brides of two or three
months say the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>“There are very few like Reginald, nevertheless,”
said Alice warmly. “I know him,
of course, better than anyone now.”</p>

<p>“Or you think you do,” interrupted Miss
Fane, “which comes to the same thing.”</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i> I do! I don’t believe he has
a thought that I might not share; he is
true, upright, unselfish. Self he never
thinks of; I am his first thought in everything.
He loves me far too dearly to bring
any such dreadful grief near me as this
certificate hints at. I will put all thoughts
of it out of my head till he comes home.
Don’t you think I am wise?” she asked
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Yes; in a certain sense you are; but
if it is not cleared up you will be all the
more unprepared to receive the shock. My
motto is, ‘Prepare for the worst, hope for
the best, and take what comes.’ This is a
very serious matter, and requires serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
thought. I have been turning it over in
my mind for the last hour. Shall I tell
you what I think?” gazing solemnly over
her glasses at Alice, who was still kneeling
at her side.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, of course. Please do,” she
replied eagerly.</p>

<p>“I think that you are by no means
the first girl Reginald was in love with,
or that was in love with him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I know I was,” cried Alice
with assured confidence; “he told me so,
over and over again,” she added with a
lovely blush.</p>

<p>“Stuff!” replied Miss Fane, viciously
spearing her ball of worsted with a knitting-needle.
“And you believed him, you little
goose! Do you think,” she proceeded in
a cool ironical tone, “that an extremely
handsome young man like him has lived
seven years in the army without as many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
love affairs to match? I tell you—and I
am an experienced old woman—I tell
you no, ten thousand times no. I can’t
say that I ever heard of any special affair.
I did hear a whisper that when he joined
he was one of the wildest of wild boys;
but I believe, thanks to his father, he soon
steadied down. But take my word for it,
young men in the cavalry are a wild,
bad lot.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean—that—Reginald——?”
cried Alice, struggling to rise.</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” replied Miss Fane, keeping
her down by laying her hand heavily on
her shoulder. “Be patient, and hear what
I have to say. I only mean taking them
generally—no one in particular. Reginald,”
she resumed, “has spent a great deal of
time abroad. Who knows,” she proceeded
mysteriously, and dropping her voice to a
whisper, “but he may in some mad moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
have married a half-caste girl; and then,
tired of her, and ashamed of his folly, have
bribed her to silence and left her in India;
and she, finding his second marriage too
much for her fortitude, has sent you this
certificate! What do you think of that idea?”</p>

<p>“Think of it!” cried Alice, jumping to
her feet, and almost inarticulate with
passion. “I think it a very wicked, horrible
idea to entertain of your own nephew, and
you ought to be ashamed of it!”</p>

<p>“So I will if this certificate proves a
false one; but if not, have you thought,
my poor girl, since I must speak plainly,
of the position in which it places <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that if Reginald was married
more than two years ago, as shown by the
certificate, <i>you</i> are not his wife; you are
nothing but Miss Saville once more, with
your name and fame for ever blighted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“How dare you say so?” cried Alice,
crimson to the roots of her hair. “How
cruel, how unkind of you to talk to me like
this! I will never, never speak to you
again as long as I live. You have a bad
uncharitable heart,” she added, moving
rapidly towards the door. “What you say
never, <i>never</i> could be true.”</p>

<p>“Stay, stay,” cried Miss Fane, following
her briskly; “I would not have said all
this if I had not—if I did not <i>love</i> you, and
if I had not altogether your good at heart.
You surely do not think it can be pleasant
for me to doubt my own nephew?”—but it
was very pleasant—“I only want to open
your eyes, my poor dear child, in case of
the worst. There is no one to perform this
very disagreeable, thankless duty, except
myself. I mean all for the best, I do indeed,”
taking Alice into her bony embrace
and kissing her effusively. Alice, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
verge of hysterics, her brain reeling, gladly
escaped upstairs, to lock herself into her own
room for the remainder of the day, where
she had ample leisure to digest and understand
Miss Fane’s ideas.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Miss Fane, as we have already seen, had
no love for her nephew, and, as far as the
certificate was concerned, he was already
tried, found guilty, and condemned, in her
opinion. A domestic tragedy, such as this
promised to be, was her glory and delight.
Slander and gossip of all kinds were as the
breath of her nostrils; her letters, thoughts,
and conversation all turned in that direction;
and she was an adept at serving up
the most delicate dish of scandal, accompanied
by sauce piquante, and followed by
entrées of her own suggestions. She had the
worst opinion of the world and everybody
in general, an opinion she prudently kept to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
herself. An affair in her own little circle,
such as this was likely to be, would afford
her materials for conversation and letters
for an indefinite time. It would give her
a certain importance, too, to say: “I was in
the house at the time when it all happened;
I saw and heard everything with my own
eyes and ears.”</p>

<p>She had no respect for her nephew’s
name—<i>she</i> was not a Fairfax—no pity
for his young wife. The excitement of a
<i>cause célèbre</i> in her family caused her
neither shame nor horror; quite the reverse.
She knitted the heel of a stocking; made
an excellent lunch off fish cutlets, curried
fowl, tarts, and cream; took an airing in
the pony-carriage; and awaited Geoffrey’s
return with imperturbable mien.</p>

<p>“Alice would return to live with her,”
she reflected, “if this turned out as she
imagined; and she would make her a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
handsome allowance, say three thousand
pounds a-year, as before. Brighton or
Cheltenham would suit her best; she
loathed the country, and would be able
to give nice little dinners, card-parties,
and suppers, and keep a brougham and
pair—bays or grays—iron-grays looked
dashing; mulberry livery and silver buttons,
and of course a cockade—it looked
so smart. Perhaps a victoria, too, for
summer.”</p>

<p>Here her castle-building was interrupted
by the entrance of Alice, watch in hand—Alice,
who had not tasted a morsel all
day. She had spent hours alternately
pacing the room and reading her husband’s
letter; at one moment revived with hope,
at another sickening with despair, according
as her own convictions or Miss Fane’s
came uppermost. Pale, but composed, she
drew near the fire, and mechanically spread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
her hands towards the blaze. “Have you
dined yet, Miss Fane? I am very sorry
to have left you alone, but really my head
ached so badly there was no use in coming
down. Geoffrey will be here in ten minutes
if the train is punctual.”</p>

<p>“Then in ten minutes you will know
your fate,” said Miss Fane, laying her
knitting down and looking at the clock.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s sure to be all right,” replied
Alice bravely, but white as ashes to the
very lips; as steadying herself by the
mantelpiece, she kept her eyes fixed on
the door.</p>

<p>Miss Fane’s favourite motto, “Hope for
the best, prepare for the worst,” was suddenly
curtailed by sounds in the hall.</p>

<p>Geoffrey’s face, as he entered with a
would-be cheerful look, spoke volumes,
quite sufficient for Alice, who knew every
expression of his familiar features. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
dry lips tried to form a question, but no
sound came from them.</p>

<p>“Alice!” he abruptly blundered forth,
“they say it’s a correct copy, and all that
sort of thing. There is no use concealing
the truth. Mark and I are certain that
Reginald will clear it all up; it’s some
frightful mistake, but nothing more. I
swear it is not,” he said, taking her icy
cold hand. “Don’t you fret yourself about
it,” he added earnestly, for Alice’s white
face and stony fixed expression alarmed
him not a little.</p>

<p>“A correct copy did you say?” screamed
Miss Fane. “Good heavens, what an unprincipled
wretch Reginald must be! It’s
well his father and mother are in their
graves. My <i>worst</i> fears are confirmed.</p>

<p>“Alice, my poor child,” turning towards
her with outstretched hands, “you will
always have a friend and guardian in me.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
But her future ward did not hear her;
Alice was lying at Geoffrey’s feet insensible.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Next morning Alice had a long interview
with Miss Fane, who came to condole
and reason with her. She was in bed,
and utterly at Miss Fane’s mercy. All
her hopes were speedily nipped in the bud.
Every loophole of excuse that during the
night her busy brain had conjured up was
speedily scattered to the winds by Miss
Fane’s common sense.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt about it <i>now</i>,” she
urged; “none whatever. You must brace
up your courage, and prepare to act as a
girl of spirit. No doubt you have a
terribly hard task before you, and you
have been cruelly deceived; but for the
honour of your sex—not to speak of your
own good name—be firm. He will declare
the whole thing a lie from first to last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
and will try to soothe you down with fond
words and caresses, so as to gain time to
act; for doubtless this certificate will
give him a very unpleasant surprise. He
will spare no money, you may rest assured,
to silence the other person—Fanny Cole,
in short. I daresay he would bribe her
with half his income, so as to keep you as
his wife; but do not listen to him. Be
firm; in fact it will be best for you not
to see him, but to leave the house before
he arrives. You and I can live together as
before. At first we will go to some quiet
spot until this dreadful affair has blown
over, as I suppose you will not wish to
take any legal steps against him?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Fane!” said Alice—who had
not heard a quarter of what Miss Fane
had been saying—suddenly sitting up in
bed and pushing back her hair behind her
ears, “is it not a bad dream? Have I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
been a little off my head? It <i>can’t</i> be
true. It <i>is</i> a dream!” she said, administering
a severe pinch to her round white
arm, from which she had pulled back the
lace-ruffled sleeve. But as she watched
the vivid red mark slowly dying away,
she fell back on her pillow with a gesture
of despair. “No dream—no dream,” she
said half to herself; nevertheless, Miss
Fane heard it.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say it is no dream, but a
very sad reality. If you will take my advice,
Alice”—and here Miss Fane paused—“Yes?”</p>

<p>“You will leave this to-day, and not
await your hus—I mean,” correcting herself,
“Sir Reginald’s return.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, I won’t. I must see him
once more!” cried Alice excitedly. “He is
so clever, so clear-headed, he is <i>sure</i> to
be able to unravel this horrible mystery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>“Humph!” said Miss Fane, with a scornful
sniff, “it will take a cleverer man than
I take him to be to do <i>that</i>. A marriage
certificate is not to be explained away, or
what would be the good of one?”</p>

<p>“But someone else may have forged his
name,” persisted Alice; “may have been
married in his name two years ago.”</p>

<p>“They could hardly do that, as the
chaplain must have known him by sight.
And look at the chaplain’s own signature,
recognised and sworn to by his solicitors.”</p>

<p>“A forgery perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. What could be anyone’s
object? What would they gain? If you
will persist in shutting your eyes to
plain facts, <i>I</i> cannot help you. I am certain
he will declare the whole thing a
falsehood, and talk you over, in which case
I must warn you that all respectable society
will drop your acquaintance. This is by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
means the first event of the kind in <i>my</i>
experience. The same terrible scandal
occurred in the Loftus family only two
years ago. Mr. Rupert Loftus married one
of the Darling girls, and shortly after the
marriage another wife, married in Jersey
years before, came on the scene. Quite a
parallel case to yours. I must say I gave
you credit for more self-respect than to
imagine you would cling to a man who is
another woman’s husband.”</p>

<p>A crimson blush dyed Alice’s throat, face,
and ears; indignant tears started to her
eyes; she tried to speak, but no words
came, and, turning her head, she buried her
face in the pillow, motioning her tormentor
away with her hand. Miss Fane, finding
it impossible to carry on conversation with
the back of a small shapely head and a
huge coil of golden-brown plaits, took her
knitting and her departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>She went, but she left a shaft behind
her that rankled deeply. “Another
woman’s husband!” The thought was
maddening! Not hers? Nothing to her
any more; and he who had told her over
and over again that he had never loved
anyone but her! “You little witch,” he had
said, “you made me break all my resolutions,
for I had not meant to marry for
years and years, and, thanks to you, find
myself at five-and-twenty a married man,
with the prettiest little wife in England.”
How could he—how dared he talk like this,
and he already married?</p>

<p>Towards the afternoon Alice submitted to
be dressed, and took some tea and toast,
but remained all day in her own room.
She spent a long time sitting in one of the
windows, with her hands listlessly crossed
in her lap, and thinking profoundly. As
she watched the gray rain drifting across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
the park, uppermost in her thoughts was
Miss Fane’s parting speech.</p>

<p>Over and over again her lips framed
the unspoken words, “Another woman’s
husband.”</p>

<p>She paced the room restlessly from end
to end. Suddenly a thought struck her
as she arrested herself at the door of her
husband’s dressing-room. She had never
been in it. She slowly turned the lock
of the door and entered. It corresponded
in size to her own; but oh, how different
to that luxurious apartment! It had a
cold unoccupied feel, and she walked across
to the dressing-table on tiptoe, for some
mysterious reason she could not have explained.
There was a small photo of
herself in a stand occupying a post of
honour; a large old-fashioned prayer-book,
which she opened—“Greville Fairfax, from
his wife,” was written in a faded delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Italian hand, on the first leaf; a familiar
breast-pin was sticking in the pin-cushion;
a familiar coat was hanging on a peg.
How near he seemed to her now!</p>

<p>Her eyes, roving round the room, took
in every detail. Two old-fashioned wardrobes,
a battalion of boots, a bear-skin
and two tiger-skins spread on the floor,
a couch, a small brass-bound chest of
drawers, and a few chairs. Over the
chimney-piece hung his sabre, surmounting
a fantastic arrangement of whips and
pipes; the chimney-board itself bristled
with spurs. Above the sabre, spurs, and
whips was a small half-height portrait of
his mother, evidently copied from one in
the dining-room—a lovely dark-eyed girl,
in a white satin dress and fur cloak.
Alice stood before the picture for a long
time.</p>

<p>Reginald had his mother’s eyes, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
that his had not such a soft expression.
Yes, certainly his eyes were like his
mother’s.</p>

<p>“And what is it to me?” she thought
with a sudden pang. “What would his
mother think of him if she could but
know?” she said half aloud, fixing her
eyes on the picture as if expecting an
answer from those sweet red lips. “What
would <i>my</i> mother think if she knew all?”
she said, burying her face in her hands.
Then suddenly raising her eyes, she looked
once more round the room and walked to
the door.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” she said aloud. “Good-bye,
the Reginald Fairfax I loved, that
was everything to me in the wide world.
Good-bye,” she repeated, softly shutting
the door. “As for the man who is
coming to-morrow, he is nothing to me;
he is—oh, shameful, shameful thought!—another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
woman’s husband!” and throwing
herself on her knees beside her bed, she
sobbed as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>After a while she rose more composed,
dried her eyes, stifled her long-drawn sobs
with an enormous effort, and said to herself
aloud:</p>

<p>“I have done with tears; I have done
with weakness; I have done with <i>Alice
Fairfax</i>!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

</div>


<p>Endued in a decent semblance of composure,
but pale and hollow-eyed, Alice
came downstairs the following evening
in time to receive her husband. She,
and Miss Fane, and Geoffrey were sitting
in the drawing-room, silent and constrained:
Miss Fane bolt upright and knitting
aggressively; Geoffrey making a feint of
reading <i>The Field</i>, but in fact merely turning
over the paper aimlessly from page
to page, and surreptitiously watching Alice
above its margin; Alice, with her hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
clasped listlessly before her, making no
pretence of any employment, but staring
intently into the fire with a hard, defiant
expression on her face. Suddenly a loud
ring, and a sound of footsteps and cheerful
voices in the hall, announced the return
of the master of the house.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald entered, looking radiant.
“You hardly expected me so soon, did
you?” he said, greeting his relations in
turn. “I travelled straight through without
stopping, except for a couple of hours
in Paris. I have brought you the most
lovely Christmas-box you ever saw!” he
said, turning to Alice.</p>

<p>“Why, what have you been doing to
yourself, my dear girl?” he exclaimed
suddenly, struck by her altered appearance.
“Have you been ill?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“No,” she returned shortly.</p>

<p>“Then what is the matter?” he proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
with a smile, inwardly amazed at
his wife’s strange manner, and at the
tepid reception she had accorded him.</p>

<p>“Has the cook, our priceless treasure,
given warning?”</p>

<p>“Something <i>dreadful</i> has happened,
Reginald,” replied Alice. “I don’t know
how to tell you,” she added in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I know!” he returned cheerfully,
nodding his head towards Geoffrey.
“<i>He</i> has killed one, if not two, of
my best hunters?”</p>

<p>“Something far worse than that,”
she rejoined, staring glassily at her
husband.</p>

<p>“Can you not guess what it is?”
put in Miss Fane with venomous <i>empressement</i>,
having hitherto restrained herself
by an enormous effort. “I wonder the
roof has not fallen on you,” she continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
invoking the chandelier with a supplicatory
gesture, and casting up her flint-gray
eyes.</p>

<p>“Please leave us, Aunt Harriet,” interrupted
Alice, struggling hard for composure.
“I must speak to—to—Reginald
alone.” And turning her back to the
company to conceal her emotion, she moved
towards the fire.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald gazed from one to the
other in speechless amazement, then walking
to the door he flung it open for
Miss Fane, who left the room with ill-disguised
though stately reluctance,
throwing a warning but wholly unnoticed
glance towards the figure in front
of the fire.</p>

<p>Geoffrey, as he passed out, significantly
whispered: “Mind, my dear fellow, I don’t
believe a word of it; I stand by <i>you</i>,
through thick and thin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Stand by me in what?” muttered
Sir Reginald to himself as he closed the
door. “Have they all gone mad?”</p>

<p>“Well, Alice, my darling,” approaching
his wife, “what is all this about?” putting
his arm round her waist and drawing
her towards him.</p>

<p>“Don’t dare to touch me!” she cried
fiercely, pushing him away with both
hands.</p>

<p>“Are you rehearsing for private theatricals?”
he said with a laugh; “and am
<i>I</i> to be the villain of the piece?” Then
continuing more seriously, taking his wife’s
hands in his and looking straight into
her eyes: “Alice, tell me at once—what
is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” she replied hysterically,
snatching her hands away and searching
in her pocket with nervous haste.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this?” producing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
the anonymous letter. “It came
three days ago.”</p>

<p>He read it slowly, frowned, crushed it
into a ball, and flung it into the fire.</p>

<p>“There! <i>that</i> is my opinion of it,” he
said, turning towards her. “You would
not wish me to believe that you could be
influenced by an anonymous letter, written
by some crawling reptile too cowardly to
attempt to substantiate his lies. I hold the
writer of such a production” (pointing to
the blackened fragments now lazily sailing
up the chimney) “no better than an assassin
who stabs in the dark.”</p>

<p>“<i>This</i>, at any rate, is not anonymous,”
replied Alice, pushing the certificate towards
him.</p>

<p>He took it up, read it, turned it over,
and read it again. She observed that his
face was a shade paler, but otherwise he
was perfectly composed, as he said: “<i>This</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
is a most infamous forgery. I know no one
of the name of Fanny Cole, and I need
hardly say I never was married before.”</p>

<p>“And is this <i>all</i> you have to say?”
inquired his wife.</p>

<p>“All! Good heavens, Alice! what more
can I say? I assure you most solemnly
I was never married to anyone but you;
you know it as well as I do myself. I
never met a woman I cared to speak to
twice till I saw you that evening at Malta.
What is the good of repeating the same
old story over again—just now, at all
events—when we have such heaps of things
to say to each other? As to this infamous
certificate, I will take good care to have
it thoroughly investigated, and the whole
thing cleared up, you may rely on that.
It is my affair altogether; do not trouble
your little head any more about it.” Drawing
her towards him—“Come, are you not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
very glad to see me? Have you no better
welcome for me than this? Do you know
that I have been counting the very milestones
till I reached home; and now I <i>am</i>
here, won’t you say you are glad to see
me, my dearest?”</p>

<p>Alice leant her head against his shoulder;
she was weak, she knew it; he was talking
her over, as Miss Fane predicted; every
word he uttered found an echo in her heart—her
heart that was beating suffocatingly.
She trembled from head to foot. On one
hand was love and everything that made
life dear to her; on the other, honour, duty,
pride. She must make her choice between
right and wrong.</p>

<p>“Speak, Alice!” interrupted her husband,
getting a little out of patience at last.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll speak,” she returned in a hard
mechanical voice, abruptly releasing herself
and standing before him. “Do you know,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
she continued, with slow distinct utterance,
“that that certificate” (pointing to where
it lay on the table) “has been shown to
a firm of solicitors?”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” replied Sir Reginald, in a
tone of much surprise. “At whose suggestion?”</p>

<p>“Miss Fane advised me. Geoffrey and
Mr. Mayhew took it to a firm they could
rely on.”</p>

<p>“Well, I really think you might all
have waited for my return before taking
such an important step,” said Sir Reginald
with some indignation. “I wonder <i>you</i>
allowed it, Alice. It did not show much
confidence in me, I must confess. And
what did the solicitors say?” he proceeded,
in a cool displeased tone.</p>

<p>“They said——” and she paused; then
continued with an effort—“they said it
was a true copy!” raising her eyes to his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“A true copy!” he echoed. “I never
heard such nonsense in all my life—<i>never</i>!”
he exclaimed emphatically. “When there
is no original, how can there be a
copy?”</p>

<p>“I am not clever enough to argue with
you, Reginald; you must ask the solicitors,
they will explain. At any rate, they swore
to the clergyman’s signature; he was a
client of theirs, and they knew his writing
well.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Parry’s writing is it?” said her
husband, again taking up the certificate
and critically scanning it. “So it is!—an
admirable forgery. Poor old fellow, he
was garrison chaplain at Cheetapore. I
knew him well; he has been dead these
two years.”</p>

<p>“Probably,” persisted Alice, “the fact
of his being dead does not refute <i>that</i>,”
pointing to the paper in her husband’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
hand. “According to its testimony it
is nearly three years since you were
married.”</p>

<p>“Three <i>months</i>, you mean,” he exclaimed
with a laugh, making a desperate effort
to throw off a horrible suspicion that was
stealing over him and turning every vein
to ice.</p>

<p>“Someone has forged Mr. Parry’s name,
that is evident,” he exclaimed; “but why
or wherefore I am at a loss to understand.
I wish I had been here when this precious
document arrived,” he continued, pacing
about the room. “It must have given
you rather a start getting it in my
absence. No wonder you look pale, my
poor little wife,” he said, pausing opposite
her and looking at her steadfastly.</p>

<p>“No wonder, indeed!” she replied
significantly.</p>

<p><i>Something</i> in her look and tone confirmed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
his former conviction. Gazing at
her fixedly for some seconds, he said:</p>

<p>“It is not possible that you doubt me,
Alice?”</p>

<p>Dead silence.</p>

<p>“Answer me at once,” he demanded
sternly, as she stood dumb before him.
“Do you hear me, Lady Fairfax?” he
persisted, exasperated by her silence.</p>

<p>“You can hardly expect <i>Lady Fairfax</i>
to hear you,” she replied in a cool, chilly
voice. “She is not here.”</p>

<p>“You will drive me mad, Alice,” he
cried vehemently; “you could not in your
heart believe this monstrous invention. I
solemnly swear to you—you alone are my
wife; you <i>know</i> it is the truth. Why do
you torture me like this? If I thought
you really doubted me, as sure as you
are Alice Fairfax I would never forgive
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“Then you are taking a very weak oath;
for it seems to most people who have seen
that paper that <i>I</i> am not Alice Fairfax.
Show it to whom you will, they will say
that <i>I</i> am not your wife.”</p>

<p>“Is that <i>your</i> opinion?” he asked
sharply.</p>

<p>“It is,” she replied boldly; “I have no
other alternative. I have been thinking a
great deal the last two days—thinking
more than I ever did in all my life before,
and I can come to no other conclusion
than that you <i>were</i> married to that woman.
Your aunt entertains no doubt of your
infamy, neither do I.”</p>

<p>“Alice, am I mad? am I dreaming? or
do I really hear you distinctly tell me that
you are no longer my wife, and that <i>you</i>
entertain no doubt of <i>my</i> infamy? Am
I out of my mind, or are you? Am I
still asleep in the train, or am I in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
waking senses?” he said, looking at her
fixedly with his keen dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Whether you are mad or not I cannot
say,” she retorted scornfully. “I hope you
are sane enough to understand that I leave
this house to-morrow, never to return. For
the future, you and I are <i>strangers</i>.”</p>

<p>“This is mere childish folly,” returned
her husband angrily; “you don’t know
<i>what</i> you are saying. Because Miss Fane
has been wicked enough to put all manner
of hideous ideas into your foolish head, you
are ready to run away like the orthodox
heroine of a three-volume novel.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose?” he continued very
gravely, “that I shall permit you to take
the law into your own hands like this, or
suffer you—a girl in your teens, a three-months’
wife—to leave your home in such
a manner? Is <i>this</i> the way you keep your
wedding vows——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Wedding vows!” interrupted Alice,
hastily pulling off her ring and tossing it
on the table, where it spun for a second,
and then collapsed into silence. “Wedding
vows! I’ve none to keep! I am free!
Show that certificate to whom you will,
even to the most ignorant, and they will
say, that whoever may be your wife—<i>I</i> am
not——” She paused for a moment, half
choked. “And not being your wife, you
can scarcely expect my father’s daughter
to remain <i>here</i>. You are a hypocrite,”
she continued, speaking rapidly and
trembling with excitement. “A hypocrite!
for you appeared to be all that was good;
and I know you to be all that is bad——It
<i>was</i> bad, wicked, shameful,” stamping her
foot, “to deceive an orphan confided to
your care.”</p>

<p>She paused again, breathless.</p>

<p>“Pray go on, madam—do not spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
me,” said her husband hoarsely. He was
leaning one elbow on the chimney-piece.
Indignation, horror, and scorn were
chasing each other in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You married me,” resumed Alice, “or
rather <i>pretended</i> to marry me, because I
was your ward. It was an easy way to
solve <i>that</i> problem, which must otherwise
have been a trouble and a bore. I was
young, rich, and, if <i>you</i> were to be believed,
exceedingly pretty—nothing could be more
suitable; but why did you forget that you
had a wife in India? Had you not better
bring her home? Her position may not
be properly understood at Cheetapore,”
with withering contempt.</p>

<p>Smash went a valuable, a priceless old
chimney ornament, thanks to Sir Reginald’s
restless elbow.</p>

<p>“I shall go away to-morrow, say what
you will, and never see you again as long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
as I live. You may hush the matter up;
you may say that I am dead. You have
nothing to fear from me. I have neither
father nor brother. In years to come I
may forget you, and I may forgive you;
but should I live to be a hundred, I will
never see you or speak to you again.”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, and looked at
her husband with glowing angry eyes. She
had relieved the pent-up feelings of her
heart in a perfect torrent of reproach. Her
utterance was so rapid as to be almost
inarticulate, and the tide of her passion
carried all before it. With a motion to
Sir Reginald to permit her to pass, she
was preparing to leave the room.</p>

<p>He by this time was as white as a
sheet, otherwise a vein down the centre
of his forehead alone betrayed emotion.</p>

<p>Whilst Alice was shaking with excitement,
he was perfectly cool and self-possessed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
but a kind of repressed sound in
his voice when he spoke would have told
a bystander that his temper was now
thoroughly roused, and that <i>he</i> was by far
the more incensed of the two.</p>

<p>“Lady Fairfax,” he said with emphatic
distinctness, “permit me to delay you for
one moment,” interposing himself between
her and the door. “I quite enter into
your wishes. The sooner we part the
better. I will have no wife who suspects
and despises me. A woman holding such
views of my character I have no desire
to see again. A wife who is ready to
cast me off on the smallest and most unfounded
suspicion—who does not even
grant me a chance of proving my innocence—but
tries, convicts, and condemns
me unheard, is no wife for <i>me</i> except in
name. I shall make all arrangements for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
your comfort, but I cannot bring myself
to discuss them now. You can remain
here till our future plans are arranged.
Your father’s daughter occupies the same
position beneath this roof as did my
mother, although you may pretend to
think otherwise. Had I been as wise a
year ago as I am <i>now</i>, your father’s
daughter would never have been my
<i>wife</i>.”</p>

<p>Taking up the certificate and the ring,
he turned and walked out of the room
without another word.</p>

<p>On his way across the hall he was waylaid
by Geoffrey, who sprang on him from
the billiard-room and seized him by the
arm, saying:</p>

<p>“Well, Rex, I suppose she has told
you?”</p>

<p>“She has,” replied Reginald, shaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
him off impatiently as he entered the
library and threw himself into an armchair.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe one word of it, mind
you, Rex; and as for Alice, she is nothing
but a silly girl, with a hot temper. It all
blows over. I know her rages well,” he
added consolingly.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me now, there’s a good
fellow,” returned Sir Reginald, jumping
up and pacing the room. “Run down
and tell them to bring round ‘Dragon’
and the dog-cart, and to put in my portmanteau
just as it came.”</p>

<p>“Why so, in the name of all that’s
mad?”</p>

<p>“I’m off to London by the mail.”</p>

<p>“Are you in your sober senses,
Reginald?” exclaimed Geoffrey, looking
at him aghast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“I scarcely know,” he returned, wearily
passing his hand across his forehead;
“but I am quite certain of one thing,
and that is, that Alice and I have parted
for ever.”</p>

</div>


<p>It is needless to say that all this excitement
upstairs had created no small stir in the
lower regions. The servants held a court
of inquiry on it over their meals, and
discussed the subject in all its bearings
and from every point of view. Susan
Parker, lady’s-maid, examined and gave
evidence that on Tuesday night she was
called to her lady, who was in a dead faint
in the drawing-room; that the two following
days she had kept her room, refusing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
eat or drink, save a very little toast, or tea;
and that she sat all day long looking as if
she was crazed, with her hands clasped idly
before her, and that she, Susan, had
surprised her more than once reading a
letter and crying bitterly.</p>

<p>John Scott, groom, gave evidence that by
order of Markham, the coachman, he had
driven the dog-cart over to meet his master
by the eight-o’clock down train. That Sir
Reginald was never in better spirits in his
life, asked him how they were all at home,
talked of going to the meet at Copperley
Gate next day, and drove along at his
usual spanking pace, smoking a cheroot, as
happy as you please.</p>

<p>That an hour after they got home, as
he was at his supper in the servants’-hall,
Mr. Geoffrey had come down and beckoned
him out, and told him to be ready with the
dog-cart in ten minutes, as Sir Reginald<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
was going up by the mail. That when he
was ready at the side door, his master had
come out, shaken hands with Mr. Geoffrey,
and driven away as if the Old Boy himself
was after him.</p>

<p>They were just in time for the train,
and Sir Reginald jumped out and tore off,
leaving his portmanteau and rug behind
him.</p>

<p>It was agreed on all hands that there
had been an awful row between Sir
Reginald and Lady Fairfax, but they were
obliged to return a verdict of “Cause not
known.”</p>

<p>The following morning Reginald called
at the Mayhews’, and found them at
breakfast.</p>

<p>“By Jove, my dear fellow, how seedy
you look!” exclaimed the Honorable Mark.
“I suppose you had it roughish in the
Channel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“No; I arrived yesterday, and went
straight to Looton.”</p>

<p>“Then you had it roughish there instead,”
remarked Mr. Mayhew with a grin.</p>

<p>“Mark, I have come to speak to you
about this,” said he, producing the certificate
and handing it over to him. “You
don’t believe it, do you? he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Not I; no more than if it were myself,”
said Mr. Mayhew, pausing in the
act of voraciously devouring a grill. “I
stand by you, Rex.”</p>

<p>“And you, Helen?”</p>

<p>“And I also, Regy. Although appearances
are against you, I believe in you
firmly. You need not have asked,” she
added, sipping her tea and speaking
between every sip.</p>

<p>“I really wish you would sit down and
have some breakfast instead of standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
on the rug in that uncomfortable way.
Have a cup of tea at any rate, and we’ll
talk it over together.”</p>

<p>Her woman’s heart was touched by his
haggard wan face. He looked as if he
had not slept for nights, and although his
“get-up” was as studiously correct as
ever, there was a careless, reckless air
about him that half frightened her. He
looked like a man on the brink of a
brain fever.</p>

<p>“Nothing for me, thank you. If I were
to swallow a morsel it would choke me
just now. I need not assure you, Mark and
Helen, that the certificate is a most wicked
forgery. I never heard of, much less
married, Fanny Cole, nor anyone but Alice
Saville. I must unwittingly have made
some bitter enemy to bring down on
myself such diabolical vengeance, uprooting
my home and estranging my wife.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Alice believes it then?” they cried in
one breath.</p>

<p>“Yes, so she has told me. She declares
she is no longer my wife, and will never
see me again. She means to leave Looton
and live in remote retirement with Miss
Fane, where, reversing the Elizabethan
valediction, she will do her best to forgive
and forget me.”</p>

<p>“Reginald!” said Helen with wide-open
eyes, “you are joking.”</p>

<p>“Do you think this a subject for jests?”
he said sternly.</p>

<p>“Did you not reason with her?” asked
his cousin vehemently.</p>

<p>“I did; I assured her of my innocence,
on my word of honour. I reasoned with
her as temperately as I could, till she
nearly goaded me to madness. I could
not trust myself to tell you what she said;
but she concluded the interview by flinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
me her wedding-ring. Here it is,” said
he, taking it out of his waistcoat-pocket
and laying it on the table between them.</p>

<p>At this tangible proof of the rupture
they both stared in silent consternation.
Presently Helen said:</p>

<p>“I need not tell you, Regy, how young
and inexperienced she is—not yet eighteen.
Make allowances for her, for she naturally
received a great shock, and has been ill-advised
by Miss Fane, whom, you know,
I never could bear. Do not be hasty in
taking Alice at her word; you know she is
very fond of you.”</p>

<p>“If you had been present last night you
would scarcely have said so,” returned Sir
Reginald dryly; “but I have written to
her this morning to say that, if she changes
her mind, a line to the Club will find me
for a week. She may have been carried
away in the heat of passion to say more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
than she thought or meant. After a week
it will be too late; I shall accept the
liberty she offers me, and return to my
profession. Fortunately my papers have
not gone in yet. Now I must be going.
You shall see me this day week.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, man, you are coming to stay
here.”</p>

<p>“No, Mark; many thanks to you. You
would find me a restless, unbearable inmate.
In a week’s time I shall have settled down
and grown more accustomed to my fate—if
fate it is to be. Meanwhile, I shall
spare neither time nor money to find out
the author of this certificate, scoundrel
that he is!”</p>

<p>“Reginald, I am sure a man never sent
it,” said Helen. “I’m sorry to say it
of my own sex, but it’s safe to be a
woman.”</p>

<p>“My dear Helen, if you knew how very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
small my circle of lady acquaintances in
India was you would not say so. I don’t
think so badly of your sex. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The allotted week having elapsed, Sir
Reginald found himself once more in
Wessex Gardens, this time to dinner. He
was no longer the pale half-distracted man
we had last seen him. He looked quiet
and self-possessed, as if his fate had overtaken
him, and he had submitted to it
without a struggle. There had been no
letter from Alice; his plans were fully
formed, and he would unfold them after
dinner—this much he imparted to Helen
as he escorted her downstairs.</p>

<p>During dessert the children came in—Hilda,
aged six, and Norman, eight—both
delighted to see their special favourite,
Uncle Regy. But Uncle Regy was very
slow this evening—no stories, no paper
boats, no rabbits on the wall. True, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
took Hilda on his knee, gave her all his
grapes, cracked walnuts for her, with the
reckless profusion of a young man, not
an experienced paterfamilias, and finally
carried her up to bed. But even the
children could see that something was
amiss, and told their nurse that Uncle
Regy never laughed nor showed his nice
white teeth once, and they thought he
must be sick, he looked so solemn.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Helen, as she poured out
coffee, “let us have it all. What have you
been doing, Regy?—and what are you
going to do?”</p>

<p>“I have placed the certificate in the
hands of a first-rate detective, for one
thing; I have written to the chaplain at
Cheetapore; and I have effected an exchange
from the Fifth to the Seventeenth
Hussars—now in India—and go out with
drafts early in February.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>“Oh Regy, to India again so soon?”
said Helen with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” affecting not to observe them.
“Is it not a good thing now I have
the Service to fall back on? After all,
India is not half a bad place for soldiering,
and we are sure to have a row out there
ere long.”</p>

<p>“But why leave this country? Why not
stay at home?”</p>

<p>“Because it will the more effectually
muzzle Mrs. Grundy. It will be less
marked than if Alice and I both lived
in England and kept up separate establishments.”</p>

<p>“But would you?” asked Helen in
an awe-struck tone.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Alice has stood to her
guns, and as ‘Trust me all in all, or
not at all,’ is my motto, we should
never get on. As a married couple our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
career is finished. I remember hearing a
cynical old bachelor say that the marriage
service, instead of being the prelude to
happiness and harmony, was almost always
the ceremony that inaugurated a long and
arduous campaign, a series of skirmishes,
varied with numerous pitched battles.
Alice and I have had one desperate engagement,
and both vacate the field.
We live to fight another day, but not
with each other! Our married life was
a short one—barely four months—and I
find myself once more a bachelor; for
as Alice declares she is not my wife,
and as I equally solemnly declare that
the other is not my wife, I conclude I
am single. What do you think, Helen?”</p>

<p>“I think you are talking a great deal
of nonsense, my dear Regy, and though
you rail at matrimony <i>now</i>, in your heart
you know very well that the last four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
months were the happiest of your life.
You need not deny it, and if you did
it would be useless. Go on,” waving her
fan imperiously, “go on; tell me what
you are going to do about Alice.”</p>

<p>“Of course she must bear my name
and live in my house, but that will be
the only tie between us. Unfortunately
I am her guardian, a post I would willingly
relinquish; but it is out of the question
to do so. However, my solicitor will
manage to represent me as much as
possible. I do not intend to be brought
personally into contact with Alice, much
less with Miss Fane, who has fanned the
flame with all her might, Geoffrey tells
me.”</p>

<p>“And how have you managed?”</p>

<p>“I have opened an account in Alice’s
name at Drummond’s, and made her
an allowance of five thousand a-year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
Her own money she cannot touch till
she is one-and-twenty, excepting five
hundred a-year, which her father very
wisely thought ample for a girl in her
teens.”</p>

<p>“Then why increase it?”</p>

<p>“My dear Helen, where is your common
sense? Alice will have an establishment
to keep up befitting her position as a
married woman. I intend her to live at
Monkswood, which has always been a
kind of dower house. I shall shut up
Looton, dismiss most of the servants, and
send all the horses up to Tattersall’s on
Saturday. I am going abroad for a month
previous to returning to India, and start
for Vienna the day after to-morrow. Now
I think I have told you all my plans;
have you any exception to take to
them?” he inquired, drinking off his
coffee and setting down his cup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“I know you of old, Regy,” replied
Mrs. Mayhew with a sigh. “Your asking
me if I take exception to any of your
arrangements is only a Chinese compliment;
once you make up your mind
nothing will alter it, so there is no
use wasting words. I think you ought
to stay at home instead of going to
India. I think you ought to insist on
bringing Alice to her senses; or suppose
you allow <i>me</i> to take her in hand?
Let her come here on a visit whilst you
go out to Cheetapore and investigate this
horrid business thoroughly.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Reginald coldly; “Alice
and I are strangers for the future. You
will oblige me very much, Helen, by
referring to her as seldom as possible.
She thinks me a hypocrite, a deceiver, a
thoroughly bad man. Such were her own
words. She could not think worse of me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
if I were the greatest scoundrel that ever
walked this earth.”</p>

<p>“Reginald, I am sure she does not,”
pleaded Helen.</p>

<p>It was in vain she begged him to reconsider
his decision. He listened to all
she had to say with a kind of contemptuous
tolerance.</p>

<p>“Very kind of you, Helen, to take her
part in this way; very good of you to
defend her; but, as you yourself remarked
just now, it is only a waste of
words.”</p>

<p>One has a good opportunity of studying
Sir Reginald Fairfax as he stands on the
rug looking down on Mrs. Mayhew, who,
leaning back in the easiest of chairs, is
slowly fanning herself.</p>

<p>Tall, slender, and graceful, his well-cut
evening clothes fit him and suit him
admirably. “Gentleman” is stamped on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
every line and lineament, and there is a
leisurely ease and deliberation about everything
he says or does; the repose that
stamped the line of “Vere de Vere”
is not wanting in the Fairfax family.
His eyes are the most striking feature—so
dark, so cool, so keen, they seem to
read one’s thoughts like a book, to
penetrate one through and through. His
delicately-chiselled high-bred nose (to particularise
each feature impartially) and
proud sensitive nostrils he inherits from
a long line of ancestors. Do not dozens
of similar profiles adorn the walls of the
gallery at Looton? There is a certain
look about his well-cut lips—barely to be
guessed at beneath his dark moustache—that
to a close observer indicates a resolute,
not to say imperious, disposition;
and something altogether intangible in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
bearing points out the soldier. A handsome,
dark, daring face one could easily
imagine leading the headlong hurricane of
a cavalry charge.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br><span class="small">MRS. MAYHEW’S LITTLE SCHEME.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Mrs. Mayhew was most decidedly the
clever woman of the family. Not only
had she brains, but an unusual allowance
of common sense, and a kind heart to boot.
She was dark and good-looking, like most
of the Fairfaxes, and inherited no small
share of their force of character and determination.
Having no brother of her own,
she had always appropriated her cousin
Reginald as such, since he, at the ripe age
of six, had made impassioned love to her,
a grown-up young lady of seventeen. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
absolutely ruled all the men of her family
(husband included) with a mild and gracious
sway, always with the notable exception of
her cousin “Regy.” His head had never
yet bent under her yoke, and he had the
audacity to differ from her on many vital
subjects, and held the heresy that “it was
for man to command, woman to obey, all
else confusion.” Nevertheless he possessed
a place in Mrs. Mayhew’s heart second
only to that occupied by her husband and
children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mayhew was never happier than
when she was managing other people’s
affairs, for which she had a singular aptitude.
To do her justice, she meddled
with the very best intentions, and her
hands were always full. She was the confidante
of lovers’ quarrels, of matrimonial
differences untold: from the servant out
of place to a girl jilted by her intended,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
all came to Mrs. Mayhew, and to them
she lent a ready ear, her sympathy, and
assistance. Her only serious trouble was
her rapidly-increasing tendency to <i>embonpoint</i>,
and she sighed when she ordered
each new dress to be made with an increasing
width of waist. Her weakness,
her particular pet vanity, were her hands
and feet; and certainly she had every
reason to be proud of them.</p>

<p>“Tell Helen she has the prettiest foot
in London, and she’ll ask you to stay
for a month,” was one of Geoffrey’s impudent
remarks; and he also declared that
knitting, to which she was much addicted,
was merely a framework supplied by her
vanity, in order to flourish about and show
off her hands.</p>

<p>She was sitting at the fire one dripping
February afternoon knitting the following
thoughts into a stocking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“This is the 8th. Let me see” (referring
to a paper on her knees), “the <i>Alligator</i>
sails on the 26th. Not much time to be
lost. I must make one desperate effort
to try to reunite this wretchedly headstrong
young couple. I’ll take Norman
down to Southsea next week for change
of air for his cough, and once established
in our old lodgings I can easily carry on
operations.”</p>

<p>Here her husband entered, and she laid
her plans before him.</p>

<p>“Go to Southsea, my dear, by all means,
but whatever it may do for Norman’s cough,
I don’t think it will be of much use as far
as Alice and Reginald are concerned. There
is no answer yet from the army chaplain.
The detectives are no wiser than we are
ourselves. Besides which, that old scorpion,
Miss Fane, has Alice talked out of
all her senses by this time, be sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“But I anticipate a great deal from an
unexpected meeting, nevertheless. I’ll get
Alice over from Sandown to spend a few
days, and ‘you shall see what you shall
see.’ You know that she and Miss Fane are
there, and have taken a house till April.”</p>

<p>“Please yourself and you please me;
but I have a conviction that your little
plot will be no go. Reginald’s temper is
like what the Irish cook said of your own:
‘That you were a good Christian lady,
but when you were riz, you <i>was</i> riz;’ and
he is very much <i>riz</i> indeed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t wonder at it, I must
say. You would have been, to say the
least of it, <i>annoyed</i> if I had, after being
married to you a few months, called you
a hypocrite and deceiver, and left you,
after throwing you my wedding-ring; you
knowing yourself to be entirely innocent
of any blame all the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, very true; but no such volcano
as this certificate ever burst out in your
home. Pray what would you have done,
or say you would have done, in such a
case?”</p>

<p>“I would have trusted you, Mark.”</p>

<p>“Humph.” What an extraordinary
amount of unbelief a grunt can convey.</p>

<p>“Ah well, perhaps you would. Such
trust is, however, much easier in theory
than in practice. Make some allowance
for Alice, poor girl, although we all know
she is in the wrong. It’s a bad business—a
bad business.”</p>

<p>So saying, he opened his paper with an
impressive rustle and buried himself in
the news of the day.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A fortnight had passed. The Mayhews
were domiciled at Southsea, and Alice had
come over to stay with them for a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
days after an immense amount of coaxing,
and finally being “fetched.” She was as
deaf as an adder to all Helen’s eloquent
reasoning and remonstrances, and even
Mark was out of patience with her at
last. She had been primed by Miss Fane
with answers to every argument, and had
given her her most solemn promise never
to yield an inch until the certificate was
thoroughly disproved. There had been a
letter from her husband to Helen, saying
he was coming down on Monday to bid
“Good-bye,” as he was to sail the following
Thursday; and he mentioned that he
wished to have an interview with his wife, so
that her being on a visit at the Mayhews’
was most convenient. She was not told
of his probable arrival, in case it should
scare her away. She knew that he was
shortly going to India, but where he was,
or when he was going, she had no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
of knowing, and was too proud to ask,
and Helen was far too angry with her to
offer any gratuitous information.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon Helen and Alice
were sitting in the drawing-room, the latter
pouring out tea at a low gipsy table, and
looking very fair, girlish, and lovely in a
thick black damassé silk of most artistic
cut, with lace ruffles at her throat and
wrists. Helen, lounging opposite in a
capacious armchair, was reading aloud
tid-bits from <i>The World</i>, and occasionally
glancing towards the door.</p>

<p>Norman and Hilda, with scrambling feet
and buttered fingers, were making Alice’s
life a burden to her; and she was by no
means so tolerant of these young aggravations
as her husband would have been.</p>

<p>“More sugar; more sugar, Alice!”
cried Norman, passing a very sloppy cup
recklessly towards her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>“No, my dear Norman; I gave you two
lumps.”</p>

<p>“Give me another two, for I have fished
them out and eaten them. Come, look
sharp!”</p>

<p>“Norman!”</p>

<p>“If you don’t I’ll take that arrow out
of your hair and pull it all down, and
you’ll see how nice you’ll look if visitors
come.”</p>

<p>“If you do——” began Alice indignantly.
Just at this crisis the door opened and
admitted Mark, Geoffrey, and Reginald.</p>

<p>The children made a violent charge
towards the latter.</p>

<p>“Uncle Regy, Uncle Regy! where have
you been all this long time? What have
you brought us?” they cried, leaping and
dancing expectantly round him.</p>

<p>Alice glanced up hastily. He was shaking
hands with Helen. What was she to do?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
Would he shake hands with her? Yes;
in another second she found her hand in
his; and then he turned to the children.</p>

<p>“Give me a cup of tea, Alice,” said
Geoffrey, drawing a chair close to the tea-table,
and staring at her with a very
unpleasant critical scrutiny.</p>

<p>Her hands trembled so violently she
could hardly hold the teapot; the colour
sank from her cheeks, and her heart beat
so fast it seemed as if it would choke her;
but she made a brave struggle for self-command,
and endeavoured to converse
easily and indifferently with Geoffrey whilst
her husband was talking to Helen. Presently
she stole a look at him; he was
standing on his favourite place—the rug—and
she met point-blank the steady
glance of his keen dark eyes, fixed on
herself—a look full of interest, yet grave
and stern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>She felt her face becoming crimson, and
dived under the table for her handkerchief,
glad of an opportunity of composing her
countenance. Dare she take another look?
No, she dare not.</p>

<p>At this moment visitors were announced,
and the bustle consequent on their arrival
was the greatest relief.</p>

<p>Enter two fashionable ladies with a
cavalier in tow. Reginald evidently found
favour in the eyes of one of them; he
had the unmistakable air of a man of birth
and distinction. She therefore proceeded
to make herself most agreeable, and put
him through a series of animated questions,
giving him a pretty good benefit of her
eyes all the time. Alice, looking on, felt
indignation burn within her; and yet, why
should she mind? he was nothing to her!
He had destroyed her life, as far as her
happiness went. All she valued was gone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Bravely indeed did she try to sustain a
share of conversation, and to keep up
appearances to the best of her ability. She
knew she was answering the strange young
man’s remarks at random, but she could
not help it. He was looking intensely
puzzled, as well he might, when she told
him that “she was staying in <i>India</i>, but
had come over to Southsea for two or three
days.” Oh, if she could only get out of
the room! No sooner thought than done.
She was gliding quietly towards the door,
when her husband with two steps confronted
her.</p>

<p>“Alice,” said he, “I wish to speak to
you particularly. Can you come out with
me and take a turn on the pier?”</p>

<p>Alice bowed her head in assent, and
passed on. When she came down in her
walking things—close-fitting velvet paletôt
trimmed with superb sable, and cap to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
match—she found him waiting in the hall.
Having ceremoniously opened the door for
her, they set out, and walked on rapidly,
exchanging the veriest commonplaces. The
pier was evidently to be the scene of action,
so Alice braced up all her nerve for the
encounter, and firmly determined to abide
by Miss Fane’s advice, and not yield an
inch till the certificate was utterly refuted.</p>

<p>No one meeting them would have guessed
at the storm that was raging in their hearts.
They did not look like married people, nor
lovers certainly. “A young fellow taking
his very pretty sister for a walk, most
likely,” would have been the verdict of a
passer-by.</p>

<p>Arrived at the pier, Alice summoned up
all her courage, and taking a good long
breath and a firm grasp of her umbrella,
said, with apparent composure: “Now what
have you to say to me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>“Several things as your husband, and a
few as your guardian,” he replied, leaning
against the railing and looking at her
intently.</p>

<p>“Say nothing to me as my husband, but
whatever you have to say as my guardian
I will perhaps attend to.”</p>

<p>“Then you still entertain the monstrous
notion—that I am <i>not</i> your husband?”</p>

<p>To this question Alice made no reply, and
he proceeded. “Well, I <i>am</i>, all the same.
But I see it would be a waste of time and
temper to endeavour to persuade you otherwise.
I have every reason to believe that
within the next two months all will be
satisfactorily cleared up. May I ask what
you will do in that case?”</p>

<p>“I will return to you as your wife, of
course,” she replied calmly.</p>

<p>“And do you suppose that I will receive
you then? Return to me <i>now</i>—show, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
at the eleventh hour, that you can trust
me—I will send in my papers and stay at
home. I have interest, and it is not yet
too late. I will freely forgive and forget
all you thought, all you said. It shall
be as though it had never been spoken.”
He paused, and looked at her eagerly.
“I told you,” he proceeded still more
earnestly, “that I had done with you,
that I had no desire to see you again,
but I found, on cool reflection, that I
loved you far too dearly to give you up
without an effort at reconciliation. I have
made <i>two</i>—once in London and once now—but
this, I declare to you solemnly, will
be the last. Come back to me, and trust
me, my dearest,” he said, laying his hand
entreatingly on her arm. “Trust me only
for a little time; all will, all must come
right. You will never again in all your
life have such an opportunity of showing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
your love, your confidence in me. Do you
think I would not stand by you in a
similar case? You know I would,” he
added emphatically. “Come back to me,
Alice,” he urged.</p>

<p>“No, I will not,” she replied doggedly
leaning both elbows on the railing of the
pier and staring steadily out to sea.</p>

<p>“You will not?” he repeated, in a tone
of bitter disappointment. “You cannot mean
it.” After an inward struggle with himself
he continued as before: “Think of what
you are doing, Alice. You have broken
up our home and turned me adrift—taken
your freedom and your own way. You are
sending me back to India, and God knows
if I shall ever return.”</p>

<p>“You need not go,” she replied in a
low voice, still looking out to sea, as if
addressing the ocean.</p>

<p>“Of course I must go!” he cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
emphatically; “unless you wish to have
the open mouth of scandal busy with our
names. If the world knows that I am
engaged in my country’s service it may
leave you alone. But I warn you that
society looks coldly on a young and pretty
woman living apart from her husband, and
rightly or wrongly, they almost always
throw the blame of the separation on <i>her</i>
shoulders. I know you have been influenced
by Miss Fane; I know you have.
It was not my generous, true-hearted Alice
that spoke to me that night at Looton.
You don’t know how you pained me, how
you nearly maddened me by some of the
things she put into your mouth—things
my pure-minded girl-wife would never have
thought of herself. You could not seriously
think that I had another wife living, and
that I had dared, nevertheless, to marry
you—an <i>orphan</i>, as you justly remarked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
committed to my care! Think of the
shameful crime it would be! Look me full
in the face, and tell me candidly, truthfully,
and of your own free will, whether you
imagine that I, Reginald Fairfax, could be
guilty of such a thing?”</p>

<p>Alice turned round at once and confronted
him—his face pale with emotion.
His dark, miserable eyes haunted her
painfully afterwards for many and many
a day.</p>

<p>“Clear yourself first,” she exclaimed,
“then I will listen to you. As long as
that certificate is unexplained I will never
return to you as your wife; I will never,
never see you again, as far as I can help
it, until the whole affair is refuted. I
am amazed that you should expect it.”</p>

<p>Sir Reginald gazed incredulously at his
wife for a moment, as if he thought that
his ears must have deceived him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>“Is this your last word?” he said in a
voice husky with passion.</p>

<p>She nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>Exasperated beyond endurance, he left
her side and walked to the other end of
the pier alone. Presently he returned
with firm rapid strides, and confronted
her with a compression of the lips and a
flash in his eyes she had never seen before.
Coming to a stop, and standing directly
before her, he said:</p>

<p>“That was <i>your</i> last word; now hear
<i>mine</i>. I most solemnly take God to witness”—raising
his hat as he spoke—“that
I will never receive you back as my wife
until you have made the most humble,
abject apology that ever came from
woman’s lips. You shall abase yourself
to the very dust for the shameful injustice
you have done <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>“Shall I, indeed?” she exclaimed passionately.
“You will never see a Saville
abased to the dust. I will never apologise
and never beg your pardon. Pray
do not offer your forgiveness before it is
required.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” he replied coldly, “there
is no more to be said, as you declare that
you will never apologise, and I have sworn
to yield to no other terms. We shall live
for the future as strangers, excepting that
I shall exercise over you—even though
at a distance—the authority of your
guardian till you are twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“I shall not submit to your authority!”
she interrupted hotly.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, you will,” he returned in a cool
unmoved tone. “You have as yet to learn
that I too have a will—that I am your
master—no longer your slave. I am aware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
I cannot flatter myself that you either love
or honour me,” with ironical emphasis,
“but you will certainly <i>obey</i> me.”</p>

<p>“I shall <i>not</i>!” she cried indignantly.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I am quite sure you will,”
he replied in the easy authoritative tone
with which one talks to a naughty child.
“You will live at Monkswood,” he proceeded
tranquilly. “It is smaller than
Looton, but I hope you will find it as
comfortable. Horses, carriages, and servants
will precede you there, and I hope
all will be ready for your reception in a
fortnight’s time. In the meanwhile I must
beg you will remain with Helen, as I do
not wish you to return to Miss Fane. I
forbid you to see her or to correspond
with her.” He paused to see the effect
of his words, then continued: “Your own
aunt, Miss Saville, has been good enough
to promise to reside with you permanently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
as it would be out of the question for you
to live alone.”</p>

<p>During the above long speech Alice had
been gazing at her husband with amazed
indignant eyes. Drawing herself up as
he concluded, she said:</p>

<p>“And supposing I decline to leave Miss
Fane and to go to Monkswood, what are
to be the dire consequences?”</p>

<p>“You have no other alternative,” he
replied with freezing politeness. “Unfortunately
for your independent spirit, all
your money is in my hands.”</p>

<p>“What a shame!” she cried passionately.</p>

<p>“Yes, is it not?” he answered with a
satirical smile. “A young lady with an
empty purse, and utterly cut off from her
friends, would find herself rather embarrassed,
to say the least of it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Fane will allow me to live with
her as before,” she returned confidently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“When she finds that you are absolutely
penniless, I think you will discover that
her interest in you has ceased,” he replied
significantly.</p>

<p>“Must I go to Monkswood? Must I?”
she asked passionately.</p>

<p>A bow was her reply.</p>

<p>“I suppose I am completely in your
power?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid so,” he answered composedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, if anyone else were only my
guardian! If your father had lived, or
if he had chosen Mr. Mayhew.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely echo both your wishes,
but I hope you will be able to reconcile
yourself to circumstances. You will go
to Monkswood, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I <i>must</i>—for a time at least,”
looking at him defiantly.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he replied, ignoring her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
look, “we will consider the matter
settled. Mark Mayhew and my solicitors
will look after your interests. Personally,
I will have no communication with you.
This is our last interview; from to-day we
are strangers.” After a pause he went on:
“You will hear from Helen whether I am
dead or alive; if the former, you will be
freed from every tie—you will be your
own mistress, an exceedingly rich widow,
with no one to control you in any way.
Should you marry again, as no doubt you
will, I sincerely hope your second venture
in matrimony will be more fortunate than
your first.”</p>

<p>“Reginald!” she exclaimed indignantly.</p>

<p>“He will have to be a different sort
of fellow to me,” he continued, without
noticing the interruption; “to have a
pretty thick skin; to give you your own
way completely; and to have no self-respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
whatever. Of course <i>that</i> will be
a <i>sine qua non</i>. He must not mind your
changeful moods, nor be offended, if after
telling him he is dearer to you than words
can express, and making an utter fool of
him, you turn on him at the first breath
of suspicion and call him a hypocrite, a
deceiver, a ruffian of the deepest dye, and
altogether a most infernal scoundrel.”</p>

<p>“Reginald, I never used such expressions.
How <i>dare</i> you speak to me in such
a way! How dare you treat me so!” she
exclaimed, raising her voice, much to the
amusement of two sailors, the only other
people on the pier, who were lolling over
the railings close by, and had been watching
the scene with unaffected delight.</p>

<p>“She’s giving it to him. By Jove,
Bill, that chap has his hands full!” said
one of them, turning his quid. “If he is
going to venture out on the sea of matrimony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
with that craft, he’ll happen to have
heavy weather frequent and squalls every
day.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by bringing me
here to ridicule and insult me?” repeated
Alice in a towering rage. “The marriage
certificate is still unexplained, and you
talk to me as if <i>you</i> were the injured
person—<i>you</i>!”</p>

<p>“I am glad to see that you have grasped
my meaning,” he replied coolly. “I <i>am</i>
the injured person; suspected by you, who
should be the last to doubt me—homeless,
wifeless, nevertheless innocent. I am
leaving my native land, this time a
voluntary exile. You have destroyed
my faith in womankind: a woman’s word—a
woman’s love—a woman’s generosity
are to me now merely so many
names for delusions believed in by children
and <i>fools</i>. I brought you here to tell you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
of various arrangements I had made. I
preferred a personal interview to letter-writing;
besides which, I am sure you
will be amused to hear that I had
a lingering hope you would have
believed me and trusted me, even at the
eleventh hour—a hope I now see,” looking
at her steadily, “that I was mad to entertain.”</p>

<p>“You were indeed insane to think it,”
exclaimed Alice very emphatically. “Prove
the certificate to be a forgery, and then I
will believe you,” she said abruptly, turning
to leave the pier, with a scarlet flush on
either cheek and a general air of outraged
dignity.</p>

<p>They walked homewards, that cold,
dusky February evening, in solemn silence.
Alice’s conscience was clamouring loudly
as she stepped briskly along, endeavouring
to keep up with her husband’s rapid strides.
He seemed totally unconscious of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
presence. Buried deep in his own thoughts,
he did not vouchsafe a single remark
between the pier and the Mayhews’ house.</p>

<p>“God forgive you if you have wronged
him,” said Alice’s inward monitor. “He
is going away to the other end of the
world, and you may never see him again.”</p>

<p>“But the certificate—the clergyman’s
signature so far undenied and unrefuted,”
argued Pride and Propriety.</p>

<p>Helen, who had been expecting great
things from this interview, met her cousins
in the hall on their return. One glance
at Alice was sufficient to dash her hopes
to the ground—she looked the very
picture of frigid resolution as she placed
her umbrella in the stand, and with
some trivial remark about the lateness of
the hour walked straight upstairs to her
own room, where she remained all the
evening, pleading a bad headache as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
excuse from dinner. Nor was her husband
a more hopeful subject; declining all his
cousin’s entreaties and persuasions to remain,
at any rate, till the last train, he
took his departure forthwith, Helen promising
him, as she followed him to the
door, that they would <i>all</i> come and see
him off the following Thursday. Her
inquiries and hints were in vain; no
particulars of the walk to the pier were
vouchsafed to satisfy the cravings of her
curiosity. “We are just where we were
before we ever met—we are strangers,”
was the only intelligence gleaned from
her cousin as he selected a cigar, buttoned
up his top-coat, and bade her
good-night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br><span class="small">THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND HIM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The day of embarkation arrived only too
speedily. It was a persistently pouring wet
morning, rain descending in torrents. It
cleared a little towards the afternoon,
and the Mayhews, accompanied by Alice,
started in a close carriage for Portsmouth
Dockyard. They had insisted on her
accompanying them, saying that, if she
did not, it would give rise to a great
deal of unpleasant discussion among their
friends, several of whom lived at Southsea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“It is only fair to Reginald,” urged
Helen. “He has not had time to clear
himself yet, and at any rate before the
<i>world</i> you will have to keep up appearances.
How you can allow him to go—how
you can doubt him, I cannot
imagine. You will be exceedingly sorry
for yourself some day,” she added in a
lower voice, accompanied by a look of
keen-edged meaning quite lost upon Alice,
who was staring vacantly out of the
window.</p>

<p>They soon arrived at The Hard, Portsea,
and descried the huge white <i>Alligator</i>
lying alongside. The most frightful confusion
prevailed on all sides, and the
noise and din and pushing and shoving
were beyond description. Baggage bewailed
as lost; baggage going on board; soldiers’
wives, who were being left behind, in loud
lamentation; friends who came to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
people off, rather cheery and important
than otherwise; friends who were really
sorry, and on the verge of tears; dogs
being smuggled on board; dogs being
turned out; wherever you looked there
was bustle and confusion! The Mayhew
party gingerly ascended the long and
slippery gangway, and asked for Sir
Reginald Fairfax.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was below, God bless him!”
said an Irishwoman, who was wiping her
eyes with the tail of her dress. “It’s many
a sore heart he has lightened this day.”</p>

<p>“How so?” inquired Mrs. Mayhew
graciously.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t he given ten pounds to every
woman that’s not on the strength, and is
left behind, meeself among them—and me
wid three childer? May the heavens be his
bed! may he never know sickness or grief!
May he never know what it is to have as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
sore a heart as mine is this day! May the
Holy Virgin protect him!”</p>

<p>It was in vain they tried to stem this
torrent of blessings; the woman would not
let them out of her sight.</p>

<p>Addressing herself specially to Alice,
she said:</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re his sweetheart, or his
sister, alannah! His sweetheart, I’m sure?”
she urged insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“No, neither,” replied Alice, blushing
furiously, and making a wild and at last
effectual effort to reach the top of the saloon
stairs, leaving the Irishwoman still pouring
benedictions on her husband’s head.</p>

<p>The long saloon was full of artillery,
cavalry, and infantry officers and their
friends, but Reginald was not there after
all; so, under the escort of a polite naval
officer, they again went on deck, where
they found him in the fore part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
ship, giving orders to a smart saucy-looking
sergeant, with his cap on three hairs, who
was receiving his directions with many
a “Yes, sir; very well, sir.”</p>

<p>Sir Reginald was now junior major in
the Seventeenth Hussars, and uncommonly
well he looked in his new uniform. He
received Mark and Helen warmly, Alice
politely, and as though she were some
young lady friend of Helen’s, and nothing
more. He offered to show them over the
ship, now they were there, and took them
between decks, pointed at the soldiers’
quarters, the live stock, the engines, etc.
Alice, under convoy of the naval officer,
walked behind her husband and the
Mayhews, but her mind was in far too
great a ferment to notice or admire
the order, discipline, spotlessness of the
magnificent trooper.</p>

<p>She answered her exceedingly smart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
escort utterly at random as she mechanically
picked her steps along the wet decks, the
said young sailor thinking her the prettiest
girl he had seen for many a day, and that
her feet and ankles were the most unexceptionable
he had ever come across. He
made a mental note to find out who she
was and all about her.</p>

<p>As they passed a group of weeping
women, he remarked: “They may well cry,
poor creatures, for many a fine fellow will
sail to-day that will never see his native
land again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t say that,” said Alice,
her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>“Why not? Are you very much interested
in anyone on board?” he asked with
a smile meant to be tender and captivating.</p>

<p>“My husband,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Your husband!” he cried thunderstruck.
“Are you married—you look so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
awfully young? Is that your husband—that
young hussar fellow ahead with your
friends?”</p>

<p>Alice, whose tears were now quietly
coursing down her cheeks, turned and leant
over the side in silence.</p>

<p>“Is he?” he repeated.</p>

<p>She nodded impatiently, still further
averting her face.</p>

<p>“Oh, but a strong-looking fellow like
that is sure to come back all right,” said
he, offering her the first piece of clumsy
comfort that came into his head, and much
distressed at the flow of tears that kept
drip, drip, dripping into the sea.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he thought, “what an odd
couple they are! They have never spoken
to each other yet, for all this grief.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Mayhews and Reginald
had turned and come back towards them,
and were much edified to find Alice leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
over the side, apparently studying the sea,
and a young sailor seemingly whispering
soft nothings into her ear. <i>This</i> was a
phase of her character that burst upon them
for the first time. She remained quite
motionless till they had passed, then dried
her eyes and followed them below. They
went down to the main deck and saw
Reginald’s cabin, which he shared with
another officer. Some loving hands had
done up the stranger’s side with many
a little comfort—a thick quilted crimson
counterpane, pockets for boots, and combs,
and brushes against the wall, and the
netting over his berth crammed with new
novels. All these caught Alice’s eye, and
she felt a sharp twinge as she turned and
saw her husband’s share of the cabin bare
of everything save such luxuries as the
ship provided.</p>

<p>“You are all going to stay and dine with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
me,” he said, “at the ghastly hour of half-past
four, but it will take the place of five-o’clock
tea for once. And if you like to
make a toilette,” addressing himself to Helen,
“here are brushes and combs at your service,
and I’ll take care that the other fellow
does not intrude.”</p>

<p>“But won’t it seem very odd if we
stay?” asked Helen, dying to do so.</p>

<p>“Not at all. About twenty ladies are
dining besides yourselves; so look sharp,
the first bugle has gone.”</p>

<p>He treated Alice as an utter stranger; and
Alice, now that he was really and truly
going, began to realise what she was losing.
Regret, remorse, and love were getting the
better of pride, obstinacy, and suspicion.
Miss Fane’s influence was gradually wearing
away in Helen Mayhew’s society. She
choked back the blinding tears that would
come into her eyes, and bit her quivering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
lips, so that Helen might not see her tardy
sorrow. Helen was calmly titivating herself
at the glass, and did not observe her
companion’s emotion.</p>

<p>“Come, Alice, be quick!” she exclaimed
at last. “Take off your jacket, child; your
serge will do very nicely. Here, wash
your face and brush your hair; you look
quite wild and dishevelled.”</p>

<p>Alice mechanically rose to obey her.
“What a dandy Reginald is,” she proceeded.
“I had no idea he was such a
fine gentleman: ivory-backed brushes with
monograms, and all his toilet accessories
to correspond—boot-hook, button-hook,
shoe-horn, all complete. Let’s see what
his dressing-case is like inside.”</p>

<p>“Oh don’t,” cried Alice piteously; “he
hates to have his things rummaged, I know
he does.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense, my dear girl,” opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
the case. “Here, have some white rose—hold
out your handkerchief.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, I would rather not.”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous goose, afraid to have it
because it is your husband’s! Listen to
me, Alice,” she said more gravely, putting
her hand on Alice’s shoulder; “he is your
husband as sure as Mark is mine. Say
<i>something</i> to him before he goes. Promise
me that you will. There! there’s the
dinner-bugle. Now mind,” opening the
cabin-door hastily and speaking to Alice
over her shoulder, “it will be your last
chance.”</p>

<p>They found Reginald waiting at the foot
of the stairs to escort them to dinner, where
he sat between them at the captain’s table.
Quite a number of ladies were present, but
not one to compare with Alice in appearance.
Many an admiring eye was turned
again and again to the lovely slight girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
sitting next Fairfax. A lisping sub, who
was at the opposite table, after gazing at
her for nearly five minutes, gave utterance
to the universal query, “Who is she?”</p>

<p>“I say, who the deuce is that pretty
girl sitting next Fairfax? She is uncommon
good-looking.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know, I’m sure,” returned his
neighbour; “his sister most likely. She
is downright lovely. Such a nose and
chin, and sweet kissable little mouth!”</p>

<p>“You had better not let Fairfax hear
you, my dear boy. Maybe she’s his wife.”</p>

<p>“Wife! That girl! You can just step
upstairs and tell that to the marines.”</p>

<p>“I would give a trifle to know who she
is,” remarked a third, upon whom a brandy-and-soda
had had a most reviving effect.</p>

<p>“I can tell you,” said Alice’s acquaintance,
the naval officer, who had just come
down and seated himself at the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
table; “she is the wife of that young fellow
next her.”</p>

<p>“What nonsense! He is not married.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he is,” observed a hitherto silent
youth, who had been devoting himself
ardently to his dinner, and who now
plunged into the discussion pending the
arrival of the second course. “He <i>is</i>
married, but he and his wife have had
no end of a shindy, I hear; that’s the
reason he is going abroad. Just look at
them now, as grave and as glum as if
they were at a funeral.”</p>

<p>“What a pity it is that marriage is so
often the grave of love,” remarked a cynical
little artilleryman, putting up his eyeglass
and staring across at the other table.
“They are an uncommonly good-looking
couple, anyway. The fellow reminds me
of Millais’ ‘Black Brunswicker,’ only he is
darker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>So saying, he languidly dropped his glass
and resumed his dinner.</p>

<p>The moment of parting came, and the
general feeling was that the sooner it was
over the better.</p>

<p>Putting on their hats and jackets, Alice
and Helen hastened on deck; Alice’s
heart thumping, her knees trembling,
and her face as pale as death. Here
they were joined by Mr. Mayhew and
Reginald, who were having a few last
words.</p>

<p>“Come along, Helen,” said Mark, taking
her arm and leading her down the gangway,
good-naturedly intending to give the
other couple a moment to themselves;
but if it had been to save Alice’s life
she could not have uttered a syllable.
She intended to have said something—what,
she scarcely knew—but her dry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
lips could not frame a sound, and they
reached the carriage in dead silence.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mark! Good-bye, Helen!
Good-bye, Alice!” said her husband
hurriedly.</p>

<p>Alice turned on him a wistful glance,
but a cold farewell was all she read in
his stern dark eyes. In another second
he was clanking up the gangway, a vision
of a dark-blue uniform, a close-cropped
brown head, and he was gone; and Alice
leant back in her corner of the carriage,
and gave way to a passion of weeping
no longer to be restrained.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br><span class="small">GEOFFREY SPEAKS HIS MIND.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Alice remained at the Mayhews’ for ten
days, previous to going to Monkswood.
She was very quiet and subdued in public,
but in private her feelings were not so well
under control. If the walls of her room
could have spoken, the good folks downstairs
would have been amazed at some of
their revelations. They could have told
how Alice flung herself on her bed the
night the <i>Alligator</i> sailed, and wept the
bitterest tears she ever shed.</p>

<p>“If he <i>is</i> innocent,” she said, “he will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
never, never forgive me. What have I
done? I have had the happiness of my life
in my own keeping, and thrown it away
with both hands.”</p>

<p>Leaving Alice stretched on her bed,
perfectly worn out and exhausted with
crying, her face buried in the pillows
to stifle her sobs, let us follow the
<i>Alligator</i> and see how her husband is
getting on.</p>

<p>They have rounded Finisterre, and are
having, if anything, rather worse than the
usual Bay weather. Tremendous Atlantic
rollers are tossing the <i>Alligator</i> about as
if she were a huge toy. Now she yaws
over, down, down, down to this side,
now she slowly rights herself from an
angle of at least 40°, and goes over to
that. They are having a very bad time
of it no doubt, for it has now commenced
to blow, not half but a whole gale. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
but those whose duty it is to remain on
deck have gone below—all but one tall
figure in a military great-coat, who is
standing under the bridge, and keeping
his equilibrium as best he can, considering
that he is a <i>soldier</i>.</p>

<p>He seems perfectly insensible to the
lurching ship, the torrents of water
sweeping the decks, the whistling of
the wind through the rigging, and the
weather-beaten sailors’ anxious faces. <i>Seems</i>
so only; in his heart he is saying:</p>

<p>“If this goes on she will founder. It
will be a terrible thing for all these poor
fellows and their friends at home, but a
rare piece of good luck for <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>However, the <i>Alligator</i> did not go to
the bottom, thanks to Providence, rare
seamanship, and her own sea-going qualities—but
that she never was out in anything
that tried the latter so thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
was admitted by the oldest salt on
board.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Geoffrey escorted Alice down to Monkswood
about a fortnight after her husband
had sailed. The carriage they occupied
was empty; for the first part of the
journey they had it all to themselves.
Geoffrey thought this an excellent opportunity
for giving Alice what he called “a
little bit of his mind,” so, having arranged
himself and his rug to his complete satisfaction,
in the seat facing hers, and sticking
his eyeglass firmly in his eye, he commenced:</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> are a nice young woman, I must
say. I have the worst, the very worst
possible opinion of you.”</p>

<p>“You can’t think how grieved I am to
hear you say so,” said Alice, looking up
from <i>Punch</i> with a complacent smile.</p>

<p>“It’s no smiling matter,” he replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
angrily, “you heartless, obstinate little—little—I
don’t know what to call you.”</p>

<p>“Don’t hesitate to relieve your mind;
you have generally a fine command of
language. Pray don’t let my feelings stand
in your way.”</p>

<p>“Well—<i>vixen</i>, then—a little vixen!—allowing
your <i>husband</i>”—with much emphasis
on the word—“to go out of the
country in this way: the very best, the
nicest fellow in the whole world. His little
finger is worth ten of you. Letting him
go when a word would have stopped him.
The idea of a chit like you”—with scathing
contempt—“having it in her power to
control a fellow’s movements! Now you
have sent him to that white man’s grave-yard—India—I
hope you are satisfied?”</p>

<p>“There was no occasion for him to go.”</p>

<p>“Every occasion, once you had taken
it into your head to leave him. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
could not both live at home, and apart,
without no end of a scandal—a young
couple barely out of their honeymoon.
Even now there are whispers, I can tell
you; but, as everyone knows Rex to be
a red-hot soldier, the row that they say
is going to come off out there will be
sufficient excuse to most; few will guess
the real reason of his leaving England—an
obstinate, credulous, heartless wife.”</p>

<p>“Really, Geoffrey, you have the most
astounding assurance! What next, pray?”</p>

<p>“One great comfort to me is,” proceeded
Geoffrey, removing his glass and leaning
back with folded hands, “that when this
tremendous lie is found out, and squashed,
everyone will be down on you like a
thousand tons of bricks. I am quite looking
forward to it, I can tell you,” rubbing
his hands. “Thank goodness you are not
<i>my</i> wife, that’s all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>“To be your wife!” she exclaimed contemptuously,
“what an alluring idea!
Why not suggest Norman at once?”</p>

<p>Geoffrey’s youth was his tender point.</p>

<p>“I am glad you are not my wife,”
continued Geoffrey, perfectly unruffled
by her interruption. “I remember you
as a small child, a horrid, cross, cantankerous
little monkey, flying into awful
tantrums and rages for nothing at all.
You bit me once, I recollect, my young
lady.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I never did,” cried Alice
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Pardon me; I have every reason to
remember it. Your teeth were as sharp
then as your tongue is now. You asked
my pardon, and said you were very sorry,
and all that, and I forgave you. Query,
will Reginald forgive you for the nice
trick you have served him? What possessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
him to marry you is a riddle I
have given up long ago. However, if
anyone can break you in to trot nicely
and quietly in double harness, Reginald
is the man. He stands no nonsense,
as I daresay you know by this time,
madam.”</p>

<p>“Have you done, Geoffrey?”</p>

<p>“Not quite yet. Supposing he is killed
out there, or is carried off by fever or
cholera, how will you feel? The chances
are fifty to one against his ever coming
home. If he does not, his death will lie
at your door as surely as if you had
murdered him.”</p>

<p>Now Alice, whatever fear she had of
Helen, had no awe of Geoffrey, and
whatever she might suffer from self-reproach,
had no idea of being taken to
task in this way by him.</p>

<p>“One would think, to hear you talk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Geoffrey, that you were the injured party.
Pray what business is it of yours, my
kind and complimentary cousin? If you
could contrive to mind your own affairs
and leave me to manage mine I should
feel obliged,” said Alice with much dignity,
taking up <i>Punch</i> once more from her lap
and casting a look of indignant defiance
over the top of its pages at her irrepressible
cousin.</p>

<p>“By rights you ought to be at school;
you are barely eighteen—far too young
to know your own mind; not that you
have much mind to know,” he added,
crossing his legs and gazing at her dispassionately.</p>

<p>“Much or little, it is made up on one
subject most thoroughly,” returned Alice
with an angry spot on either cheek. “If
you do not cease these civilities and leave
me in peace, Geoffrey, I shall get out at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
the next station, and travel in another
carriage.”</p>

<p>“Here you are then!” he returned
unabashed, as the slackening pace and
large sheds full of rolling stock and network
of lines betokened their arrival at
a junction.</p>

<p>“This will do,” said a high treble voice,
and the carriage-door opened and displayed
two very fashionable-looking ladies, a maid,
a poodle, various monstrous wicker travelling
cases, a varied assortment of small
parcels, dressing-cases, umbrellas, and other
light odds and ends. The party were
under the charge of a stout, red-faced,
irascible-looking old gentleman, who seemed
by no means equal to the occasion, and
was soon to be seen coursing up and
down the platform, inveighing at porters,
accosting guards, and altogether in a
state of excitement bordering on delirium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>The two ladies, the poodle (smuggled),
and many of the smaller packages found
places in the carriage with Alice and
Geoffrey; and after a time were joined
by the old gentleman, frightfully out of
breath and out of temper.</p>

<p>The presence of outsiders put an end
to hostilities between our young friends,
and their discussion was postponed to a
more appropriate occasion. Alice even
vouchsafed to accept a fresh foot-warmer
and a cup of tea from Geoffrey’s hands
in token of a truce.</p>

<p>Although the month was March, it
was still bitterly cold, and Alice shivered
as they sped along through fields still
brown, past curious old hamlets and farm-houses,
with red high-pitched roofs or
quaint black and white timbered walls;
past dumpy little high-shouldered-looking
village churches; past gray manorial halls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
peeping through their still bare leafless
woods; past flaming scarlet modern
erections in the all-prevailing Queen
Anne style; past scattering cattle and
galloping long-tailed colts, at thundering
express speed.</p>

<p>Alice saw but little of the landscape;
her eyes were dim with unshed tears, that
nearly blinded her.</p>

<p>Was ever any girl so miserably unfortunate,
so wretchedly unhappy as herself?
She had had to abide by principle and
duty—to hold aloof from her husband till
he could clear himself. But where was
Reginald now? What was he doing?
Could he but guess the awful blank he
had made in her life? Supposing that
Geoffrey’s prediction came true! she thought,
with a sudden contraction of her heart.
What would she not give for one moment’s
glimpse of him now? Query, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
she have been happier had her wish been
gratified? The picture would unfold a
hazy languid afternoon, the <i>Alligator</i> steaming
down the glassy Red Sea twelve knots
an hour; the passengers enjoying a practical
experience of the <i>dolce far niente</i>—some
dozing in cane chairs or on the benches,
their caps pulled over their eyes, gracefully
nodding and coquetting with the fickle
goddess Sleep; some playing deck-quoits;
some endeavouring, spite of drowsiness, to
interest themselves in a yellow-backed novel;
some playing draughts; some smoking;
some one or two, “though lost to sight to
memory dear,” beneath a shady umbrella,
in company with a lot of flounces and
neat little steel-buckled high-heeled shoes.</p>

<p>Down in the saloon, half-a-dozen kindred
spirits are drinking the cup that cheers etc.,
dispensed by the pretty little hands of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
pretty little woman, the wife of a colonel
returning from a six months’ European
tour, charged with quantities of nice new
dresses and a freshly-whetted appetite and
zest for flirtation. She has helped to “get
up” theatricals on board, and played her
part to admiration; she sings delightfully
piquante French songs to an audience of
enthralled fellow-passengers; she tells
amusing little stories about the other ladies
in her cabin to her ravished listeners; she
treats everything as a joke—even Sir
Reginald Fairfax amuses her. He avoids
all the ladies, never speaks to them, and
keeps aloof from the fair sex in a manner
that stimulates her vanity and her curiosity
alike. However, she has overcome circumstances,
and by a propitiously-dropped book
made his acquaintance, and finds that “he
is altogether charming, and every bit as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
nice as he looks.” This she explains to
the lady at the next washing-stand, as
she dresses elaborately for dinner.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald is compelled to come to five
o’clock tea—there is no escape for him—and
he submits to circumstances with as good
a grace as he can muster.</p>

<p>Behold the picture Alice would have seen,
had second sight been vouchsafed to her:
Pretty, very pretty Mrs. Wynyard, in a
dressy pink cotton, pouring out tea at the
end of one of the saloon tables for the
benefit of two ladies and five gentlemen,
who are all in the highest possible spirits,
and discussing the lottery that they are
getting up on passing Perim. Her husband
is the object of Mrs. Wynyard’s most
marked civilities; he has been deputed to
cut the cake, and is fulfilling the task
with wonderful skill and alacrity, and is
laughing and talking with as much animation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
as anyone else. For the moment he
has cast care behind him and closed his
eyes to the past; and, indeed, care is but
a sorry associate for a young man of five-and-twenty.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>To leave the tea-party on board the
<i>Alligator</i>, and return to Alice in the railway
carriage, does not take us more than
a second. Whilst her face is steadfastly
turned away from the new arrivals, they
have been regarding her with a long
exhaustive stare.</p>

<p>“Who are these young people?” they
ask themselves with the intolerance of
people in their own county. “The girl
is well dressed, and might be good-looking
if she had more colour and not those dark
rings round her eyes,” was their mental
verdict. These ladies themselves, attired
in fashion’s latest <i>hint</i> of fashion, by no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
means disdained to bring art (and a good
deal of art) to the aid of nature.</p>

<p>One of them was not merely rouged, she
was <i>raddled</i>; and over her head fully
forty summers had flown. Nevertheless,
her sight was still eagle-keen, and on the
strap of a dressing-case she deciphered a
card and the name “Fairfax.” Electrical
effect! Yes, “Fairfax” as plain as a
pikestaff. Was this girl the young bride,
the beauty, that there had been so much
talk about? She must be.</p>

<p>And the youth. Was he her husband?
That boy! Preposterous! If not her husband,
<i>who</i> was he, and where was Sir
Reginald Fairfax?</p>

<p>You may rest assured that she did not
keep her discovery or her surmises to herself;
and no sooner had Alice and Geoffrey
left the train than she took her companions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
into her confidence, and pointed
out with emphasis the open carriage and
imposing-looking pair of bays that were
visible above the palings outside the
station, and into which Lady Fairfax and
her companion had just stepped and driven
off.</p>

<p>Why did the bride come thus, alone?
Where was her husband? Who was her
escort?</p>

<p>The rosy-cheeked lady lived within an
easy distance of Manister, and she set
the ball of rumour and conjecture rolling
along so gaily and so speedily, that all
the matrons within miles of Monkswood
soon regarded Alice with feelings bordering
on ferocity. In the first place, she had
carried off the best <i>parti</i> in the county.
This was bad enough; but to be separated
from him within three months of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
marriage, and to arrive on their hands as
a very bad little black sheep, was surely
beyond endurance. She had <i>nothing</i> to
expect from their charity or generosity.</p>

</div>


<p>The <i>Alligator</i> put in at Malta for twenty-four
hours, and all the passengers landed
and “did” the sights. Reginald, in
company with some fellow-sightseers,
visited the cathedral, the fried monks, and
other noteworthy objects, and, sentimental
as it sounds, he strolled past the house
where he had first met Alice.</p>

<p>“Who would have thought,” he said
to himself, “that that simple, unsophisticated
girl would have turned out so hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
and unyielding? She had given him a
bitter lesson; he had done with her and
all womankind, that was certain;” but
before he reached Port Saïd his heart was
considerably softened.</p>

<p>The handsome young second lieutenant
and he were constantly thrown together,
and had become capital friends. They
were partners at whist, and frequently
played in the same game at deck-quoits.
One evening they were standing in the
stern, watching a large steamer passing
in the distance, homeward bound, when
the lieutenant abruptly broached the
delicate subject of matrimony.</p>

<p>“No one would think,” he said, critically
surveying his companion, “that <i>you</i>
were a married man.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not as clever as a friend
of mine, who declares that he recognises
a Benedict at once by the cut of his boots,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
and could swear to his umbrella,” said
Sir Reginald.</p>

<p>“You haven’t a married look about
you,” resumed the sailor, “no, nor your wife
either. I never was more amazed than
when she told me she was married.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” replied Sir Reginald stiffly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I put my foot in it rather; I
<i>always</i> do if there is the slightest aperture
for that extremity. Thinking her a girl
come on board with her friends merely
to see off some casual acquaintance, I told
her that the chances were that many of
those embarking would never see England
again. A most happy remark, was it
not?” observed the sailor emphatically.</p>

<p>“And what then?” asked his companion
with averted eyes, busily arranging
the focus of his opera-glasses.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said, “don’t, my husband
is going;” and then she burst into floods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
of tears. Such oceans I never saw; how
they poured down into Portsmouth Dock
I shan’t soon forget.</p>

<p>“Did she say that I was her husband?”
inquired Sir Reginald, looking at him
searchingly.</p>

<p>“Yes, of course she did. You are, are
you not?” returning his gaze with wide-open
curious eyes.</p>

<p>“I am,” very shortly. “After all, that
is not a P. and O. boat. Now she is
close, you can easily see that she is one of
the Messageries; yes, you were right after
all, and I was wrong,” said Sir Reginald,
changing the conversation and handing the
glasses back to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he moved away,
and leaning over the bulwarks in a secluded
spot he finished his cheroot alone. Somehow
his heart felt lighter than it had done
for a long time; and when, some hours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
later, he went below to his “horse-box,”
and found his own particular fellow-passenger
asleep and snoring, he took out a
cabinet photo of Alice, taken shortly after
their wedding, and gazed at it long and
earnestly. How happy she looked—how
lovely! Infamously as she had treated
him, there was no one like his Alice after
all. He had the weakness to kiss the
pasteboard and put it under his pillow,
and in a few minutes was sound asleep.</p>

<p>The <i>Alligator</i> of course stopped at Port
Saïd, that perennial abode of sand, flies,
and dogs; full of melancholy-looking
empty cafés chantants, where the performers,
ranged on the platforms, and
all ready to strike up, appear to be
only waiting for an audience, and audience
there is none. The sandy streets were
full of people—Jews, Turks, infidels, and
heretics. The home-coming Anglo-Indian,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
with stupendous mushroom topee swathed
in a quarter of a mile of white puggaree,
and armed with a large double-covered
umbrella, passes the out-going “Griff,” got
up in pot-hat, dogskin gloves, cane, etc.,
with a stony stare.</p>

<p>But a very little of Port Saïd goes a
long way with most people; and the
<i>Alligator</i> passengers, having laid in a
supply of eau-de-cologne, oranges, and
umbrellas, with which to face the Red
Sea, were not sorry to troop back on board
to the welcome signal of the “dinner”
flag.</p>

<p>They edged their way cautiously through
the Canal, and bore down the Red Sea
with wind and weather in their favour.
The sky and sea were like Oxford and
Cambridge blue; there was not a ripple
in the water. The far-receding Arabian
coast engaged the attention of at least a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
dozen deluded opera-glasses looking out
for Mount Sinai.</p>

<p>Oddly-shaped islands were passed, including
the notorious “Brothers,” so little
above water and so much in the line of
traffic, that more than one ill-fated steamer
has borne down on them at full speed and
sunk like a stone. Aden was left behind
in due time, and after a pleasant breezy
run across the Indian Ocean, one early
morning Colaba lighthouse was descried in
sight, and not long afterwards they were
steaming majestically up Bombay harbour,
and anchored off the Apollo Bund. To a
new arrival, how bright and gorgeous and
eastern it all looked!</p>

<p>The long low stretch of land, covered
with white and yellow buildings of all
shapes and sizes, set off with a background
of green trees; rising here and there
against the turquoise sky were palms lofty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
and graceful, which alone made everyone
realise that they were actually in the East
at last.</p>

<p>The harbour was crowded with shipping.
Steamers and sailing ships at anchor
abounded on all sides; and flitting in
every direction were native bunderboats
plying between them and the shore. Fishing-boats,
with enormous lateen-shaped
sails, were spread up the harbour towards
Elephanta. Even the grotesque junk was
represented; and altogether the scene was
novel and lively. And now for the moment
of parting and disembarking on board the
<i>Alligator</i>. None of the former were particularly
tender, for there had been no
very <i>prononcé</i> flirtations. In this respect
the troopers pale before the P. and O.,
and those who were bound for the same
station had generally herded together on
the voyage out. There was wild work at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
the railway station, but after awhile the
<i>Alligator’s</i> late freight were steaming along
to their several destinations in Bengal,
Madras, or Bombay.</p>

<p>Sir Reginald Fairfax and Captain Vaughan,
Seventeenth Hussars, along with the draft
in their charge, were forwarded to Camelabad;
and after a wearisome three-days’
journey, half-blinded with glare and
smothered with dust, they found themselves
(figuratively speaking) in the arms
of their brother “Braves.” The Seventeenth
had only recently arrived in the
station, and had barely shaken down into
the quarters vacated by the out-going
“Guides,” whose furniture, horses, and
traps they had also succeeded to, after the
exchange of sundry bags of rupees, as
horses, traps and furniture, once settled at
an Indian station, rarely leave it. An old
<i>habitué</i> will say to a new arrival—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
bride most likely, and vain of her first
equipage:</p>

<p>“Oh, I see you have got the Carsons
carriage.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear no; it is ours.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that, of course; but it was
the Carsons’, and before that it belonged to
the Boltons, who got it from the Kennedys,
who brought it from Madras.”</p>

<p>Camelabad was a lively populous station,
large and scattered. There was always
something going on. The hospitality of
the Anglo-Indian is proverbial; society, as
a rule, pulls well together. The backbiting,
scandal, and cause for scandal, so
much attributed to Indian circles, is no
worse out there than it is at home. The
fact of being fellow exiles draws people
together, and they are more genial to each
other than in their native land.</p>

<p>But to return to Camelabad. It was
certainly a very gay place; dances, dinners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
theatricals, “At homes,” not to speak of
polo matches, sky races, and paper-chases,
succeeded each other rapidly. The Seventeenth
Hussars were soon drawn into the
giddy vortex; they set up a weekly
“function,” and gave a capital ball, and
speedily ingratiated themselves with their
neighbours. They went everywhere and
did everything, “as people always do who
have not long come out,” quoth the Anglo-Indian
of thirty years’ standing with lofty
contempt. They all went out with one
exception, and he never mixed in society;
for which reason, strange to say, society
was most anxious to make his acquaintance.
The Seventeenth were repeatedly asked:
“Why does not your junior major show?
Excepting on boards or courts-martial, he
is never to be seen.”</p>

<p>“Why does he not come and call?” a
lady of high social position asked the colonel.
“I want to have him to dinner. What makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
him so unsociable? Such a handsome young
man too! I saw him at the review on the
Queen’s birthday. You must stir him up!”</p>

<p>“I can’t, my dear madam. I have tried
to stir him up, as you call it, but it was no
good. Nevertheless, he is a capital fellow;
first-rate officer; keen sportsman; and
awfully popular with men. But I take
it he does not care for ladies; got rather
a facer from one of them, I fancy.”</p>

<p>This having transpired, Sir Reginald
became more interesting than ever to the
public mind; but as all invitations invariably
met the same fate—a polite
refusal—he was in time permitted to
“gang his ain gait,” and relegated to the
ranks of the outer barbarians. He played
polo with the regimental team, rode the
regimental cracks in the sky races, and
was looked on as an enormous acquisition
by the Seventeenth, who considered him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
kind of Admirable Crichton in a small way,
his riding, shooting, and cricketing being
much above par. His personal appearance
they regarded with undisguised complacency
as a valuable adjunct to the
average good looks of the corps; and
he was installed in their opinion as an
out-and-out good fellow and thorough
gentleman.</p>

<p>“I used to be sick of hearing some of the
Fifth fellows quoting Fairfax for this, that,
and the other,” remarked one; “but, strange
to say, their swan <i>is</i> a swan after all, and
has not turned out to be that very toothsome
but homely bird—a goose!”</p>

<p>With all his popularity, he was the last
man with whom any of them would have
taken a liberty. He would have been bold
indeed who would have asked him why
he left the Fifth Hussars, not to speak of a
fine country place, magnificent shooting, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
ten thousand a-year, to lead a dull monotonous
life on the scorching plains of India?
He would have been bolder still who would
have inquired about the fair and exceedingly
pretty girl, that Captain Vaughan
had seen sitting next him at dinner the
day of embarkation. Who was she? Was
she his sister or his sweetheart? Someone
said he had a vague idea that Fairfax was
a married man; but he was silenced and
crushed by general consent.</p>

<p>Fairfax was a bachelor—crossed in love,
if you will—but a bachelor <i>pur et simple</i>.
Look at his bungalow—rigid simplicity.
Look at his room—not a bit of woman’s
work, not a photo, not an ornament. A
perilously narrow camp-bed, a few chairs,
a portable kit, a writing-table, and a
squadron of boots, and that was all. There
were a few books, chiefly on cavalry tactics
and military history, leavened with half-a-dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
sporting novels; not a French
one among them. Anything but like the
accepted idea of a smart young cavalry
officer’s lair. If, as they say, a man’s
room is a type of himself, Fairfax was
a soldier, a rigid moralist, and above all
a bachelor, and one who would no doubt
develop into an old bachelor into the
bargain.</p>

<p>Captain Campbell and Lieutenant Harvey
were sitting in their mutual verandah,
in long chairs, clad in costumes more conspicuous
for ease than elegance, smoking,
taking away the characters of their
neighbours’ horses, and minutely discussing
the approaching big races. From
horses they came to riders, and finally to
Fairfax.</p>

<p>“He is one of the best fellows going,
but I cannot make him out; he looks like
a man with a story.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>“He does; and he has one you may
be sure,” replied Captain Campbell with
conviction, languidly puffing at his cheroot.</p>

<p>“If he was the life and soul of the Fifth,
as we have heard, their ideas of mirth
and jollity are more moderate than I could
have imagined. Sometimes, I grant you,
he is in fairish spirits, and he can say
very amusing things; but, as a rule, he
is silent and <i>distrait</i>. It is certainly in
field sports and on parade that he shines
most; brilliant sociability is not his <i>forte</i>.”</p>

<p>“No, decidedly not; and yet how all
the fellows like him, from the latest
youngster from home upwards; although
he is down upon the boys at times, and
has the art of being more politely and
unpleasantly sarcastic than anyone I know.
One would think he was forty to hear
him talk, he is so circumspect and
staid; and he can’t be more than six or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
seven and twenty at the very outside.
The youngsters respect him as if he was
the Commander-in-Chief himself; and the
remarks at his end of the table are never
so free as elsewhere. There must be some
reason for his premature gravity. There’s
a woman in the case, depend upon it,”
said Captain Campbell, tossing away the
end of his cigar with an emphatic gesture.
“<i>Cherchez la femme</i>, say I.”</p>

<p>“I should not wonder. Probably he
has been crossed in love—jilted perhaps,”
suggested Mr. Harvey.</p>

<p>“She must be uncommonly hard to
please, whoever she is, for he is one of
the best-looking fellows you could see—well-born
and rich.” Captain Campbell
paused for a moment to reflect on these
advantages, and then continued: “It is
a curious thing that he never mentions a
woman’s name, and is altogether very close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
about himself and his family. Do you
remark that he takes tremendously long
solitary rides, and gives his horses the
most work of any man in the station,
for he gallops often, he gallops far, and
he gallops fast.”</p>

<p>“He never seems to care to ride
with anyone, don’t you know.” (Mr.
Harvey put in “don’t you know,” on
an average, every three words.) “I offered
my agreeable society at various times, but
he always put me off in that quiet way
of his, don’t you know; so I thought:
‘My dear fellow, <i>saint</i> as we think you,
you have some little game up, and I’ll
see what it is, don’t you know.’”</p>

<p>“That will do, my dear fellow; that’s
the eleventh ‘don’t you know.’ Stick to
Fairfax,” exclaimed his companion impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, last Saturday evening, about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
five o’clock, I saw him going out of his
compound on that new black Australian
of his; and as I was just going for a ride
myself, I nipped up on ‘Agag,’ and
struck out after him, on the sly naturally;
and a nice chase he led me—for nothing
too. He went easy enough till he got
well out of sight of the cantonment,
and then, by Jove, didn’t he put the pace
on! <i>Oculus meus!</i> how he took it
out of the Waler. He rode slap across
country as if he was mad, clean over
every nullah, big or little, that came
in his way. I had a hideous conviction that,
if I followed him, especially on ‘Agag,’ I
should come to a violent end, so I stayed
in a mango tope, and kept my ‘cold gray’
on him in the distance. When he had
galloped his fill, and exorcised whatever
demon possessed him, he came back after
a ring of seven or eight miles, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
black all in a lather, but looking as cool
as a cucumber himself. I joined him—quite
promiscuously of course—but I fancy
that he twigged he had been followed;
there was a look in those keen eyes of his
that made me feel deuced uncomfortable.
I’m certain that he has something on his
mind. A woman for choice. Maybe <i>he</i>
threw her over, and she went mad, or
drowned herself, or something, don’t you
know, and the pangs of remorse are preying
on his soul, eh?” cried Mr. Harvey, having
talked himself breathless.</p>

<p>“A lively and cheerful idea truly,” said
Captain Campbell, sitting erect in his chair.
“In my opinion it’s far more likely that
the girl of his affections has been faithless.
He never talks of a woman, never gets a
letter from one; his correspondents are all
of the sterner sex—<i>vide</i> the letter-rack—and
he keeps his own concerns religiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
sealed from every eye, and never talks of
himself in connection with any belongings.
He is a mystery, and a most interesting
one. Why did he come out here? Why
did he leave his old regiment, where he
was so popular? What makes him so
reserved and self-contained? I have watched
him at mess, when all of you were listening
open-mouthed to one of the doctor’s stories.
I have seen Fairfax, when he thought no
one was observing him, lean back in his
chair, with a sombre weary look, as if he
were sick and tired of life. And that time
when Vaughan had fever so badly, and
he nursed him, I sat up with him part
of a night. Vaughan was sleeping, and
he remained in the verandah. I fell asleep
too, and when I woke up a couple of hours
later there was Fairfax in the very same
attitude as I had left him, still gazing at
the stars, and still apparently thinking profoundly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
I watched him for a good while
before I spoke, and there was something
indescribable in his face and attitude that
made me feel very sorry for him, and I
seemed nearer to knowing him that night
than I had ever done before. Presently
I said, ‘A penny for your thoughts,
Fairfax,’ and he gave such a start as he
turned round and said, ‘They are not
worth it; they are merely about myself,
and not very pleasant ones either,’ and then
he got up and went back to Vaughan and
stayed beside him the remainder of the
night. He is one of the best fellows and
most gentlemanly men I ever knew. But
as to following him as you have done”—flourishing
a fresh cheroot in the direction
of his friend—“or ever trying to force
myself into his confidence, I would as soon
think of cutting my throat.”</p>

<p>“Did you remark him on Christmas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
Day?” asked Mr. Harvey eagerly, as if
struck by a sudden thought. “After dinner,
when we all drank ‘Sweethearts and wives,’
how taken aback he looked. I was sitting
opposite him, and he turned as pale as a
sheet. He set down his glass untasted at
first, but I remarked that he drank it off
afterwards. There is a woman in the case,
that’s certain.—Chokra! bring me a brandy-and-soda.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>This conversation took place nearly a year
after Sir Reginald had joined the Seventeenth,
and during that year two events of importance
had occurred. I will relate them
as they came. He had been several months
at Camelabad, and had quite settled down
to Indian military life, and was beginning
to look upon the short time he had spent
at home as a sort of fevered vision. He
never heard from Alice. His only correspondents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
were Mark Mayhew and Geoffrey,
with an occasional note from Helen. He
heard from her that his wife had shut herself
up at Monkswood and declined all
society, that her answers to their letters
were rare and brief, and that her aunt,
Miss Saville, had been laid up in Ireland
with rheumatic fever, and would not be
able to join her niece for some time.</p>

<p>This was all that he had gleaned about
Alice since he had left home; consequently,
when carelessly glancing through the <i>Home
News</i> one mail-day his eye was caught by
the following, “Fairfax—On the 10th inst.,
at Monkswood, Lady Fairfax, of a son,”
he was simply thunderstruck. He took the
paper over to his own bungalow adjoining
the mess and read the paragraph over and
over again—it had an absolute fascination
for him—but read as he would, it came to
the same thing. It could not be her, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
was some other Lady Fairfax; but scarcely
of Monkswood also, his common sense
urged. He felt a conviction that it was
true, and yet he could not realise it. He
a father—Alice a mother! Well, at any
rate, he was glad it was a boy. There was
an heir to Looton now, whatever happened
to him. His father would hardly have
rested in his grave if the Fairfax money
and acres had gone to the Serles and the
good old name become extinct. Yes, he
was glad that there was no chance of that
now; but as for Alice, he thought worse
of her than ever. That he should know of
their child’s birth through the medium of
a newspaper showed the contempt in which
she held him. His dark cheek reddened as
he angrily flung the paper from him and
began to pace the room rapidly from one
end to the other. He would take no notice
whatever of the event, as far as Alice was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
concerned. No, he certainly would <i>not</i>
write to her. This was the resolution he
came to, as he proceeded hastily to dress
for mess, where he was, if anything, more
silent and preoccupied than usual.</p>

<p>As he was going to bed that night he
called his servant Cox into his room—a
most exceptional proceeding. Cox was an
old retainer, who had followed him from
the Fifth, and believed implicitly that the
sun rose and set entirely and exclusively
in the person of his master the major.
He alone was in Sir Reginald’s confidence,
and naturally a silent and taciturn man;
touching his master’s private affairs, he was
mute as the grave.</p>

<p>“Here, Cox, I thought I would show
you this,” said Sir Reginald, holding out
the paper and pointing to the announcement.</p>

<p>Cox saluted, slowly read the paragraph,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
and stared blankly at his master; then
recovering his manners and his presence of
mind, said concisely:</p>

<p>“I give you joy, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Sir Reginald, pouring
out a tumbler of champagne; “you are to
drink his health and keep the news to
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Health and happiness and a long life,”
said Cox, quaffing off the toast as if it was
spring water and wiping his mouth with
the back of his hand. After staring expectantly
at his master for some seconds,
and finding him evidently buried in his
own thoughts, he added gruffly: “I
suppose I may go now, sir.” An eager
nod of assent was his only answer, and he
lost no time in backing himself out into
the verandah, and hurrying off to his barrack-room
in time to report himself before the
bugles sounded the last post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>The following mail brought a letter
from Mrs. Mayhew. She generally enclosed
a little note in her husband’s epistles, but
this was a long effusion for a wonder.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“Monkswood.<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Reginald</span>,</p>

<p>“You will have already seen the
birth of your son and heir in the paper,
and no doubt were as much astonished
as everyone else. For the last six months
Alice has lived in the greatest retirement,
seeing no one. Two or three times we
have asked her to come up to us, and
she always excused herself with one
ridiculous plea after another. A telegram
from the housekeeper last Tuesday brought
me down here the same evening, and I
found Alice very, very ill—so ill that for
several days the doctors were afraid to
hold out any hopes of her recovery. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
dared not write and tell you this last
mail, but waited till this one, in hopes of
sending you better news. Her youth and
a wonderful constitution have pulled her
through, and I may say that she is out
of danger, though still extremely weak,
and subject to prolonged fainting fits.</p>

<p>“The life that she has led for the last
few months has been the chief cause of
her illness. Morris tells me that she used
to walk for hours through the woods in
all weathers, and took so little food that
it is a wonder she did not die of simple
inanition. She never dined, but simply
went through the farce of sitting at table
breaking up breadcrumbs, sending away
the most tempting delicacies untasted.
Poor motherless girl, angry as I am with
her, I cannot help being sorry for her;
she is so innocent, so utterly inexperienced,
and so alone in the world—thanks to herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
of course. If she had been a trusting
wife, how happy and proud you would
both be now! She is so good and patient
I cannot help loving her, in spite of myself.
Her pride in her baby is simply ridiculous,
and very touching to see. To hear her,
you would think it was the first of its
species, or at any rate that nothing so
beautiful and so remarkable in every way
had ever been born. A mother at eighteen,
and looking even younger, I tell her that
no one will ever believe the child is hers.
She has about as much experience of
babies as my Hilda—a baby with a baby.
He is a splendid boy, a real Fairfax. If
I were to declare that he is like you, you
would say, ‘Rubbish, all babies are exactly
alike!’ But he <i>is</i> very like you all the
same. He is to be called Maurice, after
her father, and Mark and I are to be
sponsors. I have just asked Alice if she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
has any message for you, and she has
replied in a very low and subdued voice—<i>none</i>.
I have no patience with her. I
should like to take her baby out of her
arms and give her <i>such</i> a shaking, only
she looks so dreadfully frail and delicate—I
really <i>would</i>. I need not tell you
that now, more than ever, it behoves you
to trace the false certificate. It is too provoking
that you have not been able to
get leave to go to Cheetapore and search
personally. It is really a dreadful misfortune
the register being lost, and the
clergyman and clerk both dead; but money
can do a <i>great deal</i>, and you are the last
man in the world to spare it. I will
write again very shortly, and hope to
have good news from you before long.</p>

<p class="right">
“Your affectionate Cousin,<br>
<span style="margin-right: 1em;">“<span class="smcap">Helen Mayhew</span>.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>Helen kept her promise, and during her
stay at Monkswood Reginald heard from
her regularly; but neither line nor message
was ever enclosed from his wife, so neither
line nor message was ever sent by him.
He did not even mention her name in his
letters—letters which Helen could not
refuse to Alice’s wistful eyes—letters which
Alice read with pale face and trembling
lips, and returned without a single observation.</p>

<p>Two months later a bad attack of
jungle fever procured Sir Reginald leave
of absence. For months he had been like
a bird beating against the bars of his cage
to get away to Cheetapore, as letters,
telegrams, and inquiries of all kinds had
been utterly useless in throwing any light
on the mysterious certificate. But the
colonel of the Seventeenth Hussars was
rather short of officers, and could not spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
his smart young major, who had no claim
whatever to leave, having so recently
arrived from England; besides, his particular
motto was, “No leave,” and as an Irish
sub once angrily expressed it, “No leave,
and as little of that as possible.”</p>

<p>At last Sir Reginald reached Cheetapore,
very much knocked up by the long
journey, and a mere shadow of the man
who had left it two years previously.
The Twenty-ninth Dragoons, who had replaced
his old regiment, hospitably took
him in and “put him up.” For two or
three days he was prostrated by a recurrence
of the fever, and fit for nothing.
The first evening he was able to go out
he went and called on the chaplain. He
was not at home. Leaving a note to make
an appointment, he went on to the
band with one of his entertainers. As
they drove round the circle, Miss Mason—still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
Miss Mason—lolling back in her
carriage, could scarcely believe her eyes,
and Mrs. Chambers, her once firm ally
and now implacable enemy, could hardly
trust hers either. She said to one of
the Twenty-ninth, who lounged up to her
barouche: “Who is that in the dog-cart
with Captain Fox? He looks frightfully
ill.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Fairfax of the Seventeenth
Hussars. He has come down here on some
mysterious errand or other. He would be
much better on his way to Europe instead.
Looks as if he was going off the hooks,
doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He looks very ill indeed. What on
earth brings him here?”</p>

<p>“Well, if you won’t repeat it, I’ll tell
you,” coming closer and speaking confidentially.
“Strictly private, you understand.
Mum’s the word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, of course!”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe it’s about a marriage
certificate which someone posted home
from here, and has caused the most
frightful unpleasantness in his family.
He has a wife in England, so you may
fancy there was rather a scrimmage. He
was only just married, and to a most
awfully pretty girl too, when this particular
missive dropped in. She left him
at once, and he came out here with the
Seventeenth. He has left no stone unturned
to get the affair cleared up, but
he has only managed to come down and
see after it himself now—leave stopped.
I fancy he will make it pretty hot for
the forger if he finds him! It’s ten years’
penal servitude, is it not?”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know,” replied the
fair culprit faintly, looking very white.
“But oh! if she could only be the means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
of getting Charlotte Mason transferred to
Australia at Government expense! How
too delightful it would be!” ignoring her
own little share in the transaction.
“Did you say that his wife had left
him?” she asked, looking intently at Sir
Reginald, whose dog-cart was drawn up
close by.</p>

<p>“So he told me.”</p>

<p>“How ill and worn he looks,” she
thought, gazing at him. “Supposing he
should die!—he looked as if he had
death in his face. If he did, she would
never know a moment’s peace—never! She
would make full confession and trust to his
mercy. He would not be hard upon her,
it was not <i>her</i> fault; it was Charlotte
Mason’s scheme, and Charlotte ought to
be shown up, unmasked, and transported.”
Being a person who almost always acted on
impulse, she beckoned to Captain Fox as
soon as her former cavalier had sauntered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
away, and asked him to tell Sir Reginald
Fairfax that she wished to speak to him
particularly. Much bewildered and with
great reluctance he slowly followed the
messenger to the carriage, where Mrs.
Chambers, with a rather frightened white
face, accosted him:</p>

<p>“I see you do not remember me,
Captain Fairfax? It quite shocks me to
see you looking so ill.”</p>

<p>He bowed and muttered inaudibly.</p>

<p>“Won’t you get into my carriage for
a little, and we can talk over old times?”
Seeing him hesitate, she bent over the
side of the carriage and whispered in
his ear: “It’s about the certificate.”</p>

<p>With an alacrity she was quite unprepared
for from his languid and delicate
appearance, he accepted her invitation and
took a seat opposite her, and turning his
clear dark eyes upon her, looked as if he
would read her very soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Captain Fox sauntered off to
join a promenading dandy, muttering to
himself: “That Mrs. Chambers sticks at
nothing; she is becoming faster and more
foolish than ever! The idea of her tackling
a strange fellow like that! I had no idea
he was such an ass! A regular case of
‘“Walk into my parlour,” said the spider
to the fly.’”</p>

<p>“Sir Reginald,” said the spider to the
supposed fly, “I have something to tell
you,” and forthwith she unfolded her tale
from beginning to end. When she came
to the part where she mentioned it as a
joke his eyes literally blazed, and he seemed
with difficulty to refrain from some exclamation;
but till she concluded he was
perfectly silent. When she stopped to
take breath after her hurried confession, he
asked, with pardonable vehemence:</p>

<p>“What have I ever done to Miss Mason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
or you that you should do me such a
deadly injury? Do you know that the
happiness of my life has been utterly
destroyed by your ‘joke,’ as you are
pleased to call it? I must say that your
and Miss Mason’s reading of the word is
very different to mine. The least you can
do, and <i>shall</i> do,” he said, looking at her
sternly, “will be to make out a written
confession of everything, and send it up
to my quarters (Captain Fox’s) to-morrow.
I can hardly believe that you can have
been the credulous tool you would appear.
Good evening,” he said, springing out of
the carriage and walking over towards that
of her confederate, who had been watching
the conference with the liveliest dismay.</p>

<p>“Miss Mason,” he exclaimed abruptly,
perfectly heedless of two of Miss Mason’s
satellites, who, with elbows on the carriage,
and got-up with enormous care, had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
regaling the fair Charlotte with scraps of
the latest gossip—“Miss Mason,” he
reiterated, “I know <i>all</i>!” There was an
indignant tone in his voice and an angry
light in his eyes that absolutely cowed <i>her</i>
and astounded her companions. “You have
forged an infamous lie, you have tampered
with a church register, you have caused the
greatest misery to a man who never wronged
you, and to a girl whom you have never
even seen! You are a forger,” he continued,
almost choked between the two emotions
which were struggling in his breast—joy
and rage. “Unless by to-morrow morning
you have made a full and explicit written
statement of the whole affair, duly signed
and witnessed, I shall submit the case to
the cantonment magistrate, and you will be
prepared to take the consequences. Penal
servitude is what you deserve,” he added
with bitter emphasis, as with a parting look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
of unspeakable indignation he turned and
made his way through the crowd.</p>

<p>His face was livid, his eyes burned like
two coals. Captain Fox gazed at him
in undisguised astonishment. “Jove!” he
thought, “what a temper the fellow must
have! He looks ready to jump down the
throat of all Cheetapore this instant. He
is not a man I should care to trifle with.
The fair Chambers has evidently put him
out, to say the least of it.”</p>

<p>Sir Reginald hurriedly took him aside,
and in as few words as possible told him
the story; and then Captain Fox’s face
was a study. His indignation knew no
bounds. His expressions in connection
with Miss Mason’s name were startlingly
strong and vehement, and he laid the whip
about his unlucky harness hack as if he
had the fair culprit herself between the
shafts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Chambers’ “letter” arrived the following
morning, and although somewhat
more pressure had to be brought to bear
on Miss Mason, her confession was received
in due time. Both were enclosed to Mr.
Mayhew, who was to read them and forward
them to Monkswood.</p>

<p>“Now she will, she must give in,” thought
her husband. “In two months her letter
will be out here, and in three, please goodness,
I shall be in England.”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to state that the
whole story of the practical joke was all
over Cheetapore in less than two days.
Captain Fox was by no means reticent on
the subject, which was soon known to all
the Dragoons, and from them filtered to
the cantonment in general. Sir Reginald
was the object of universal sympathy, and
interest was considerably augmented by the
rumoured youth and beauty of his wife.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
The whole incident had a romantic flavour
about it that gratified the jaded palates of
the Cheetapore <i>monde</i>, and it afforded
them an universally interesting nine-days’
wonder. As to Miss Mason, the place was
literally too hot to hold her. She and her
colleague were put into “Coventry” forthwith.
Finding such a position unbearable,
she took the earliest opportunity of leaving
the station and going on a long visit “up
country.” But wherever she went the story
was whispered with various additions, <i>cela
va sans dire</i>; and to the end of her life
she will have good reason to regret her
<i>practical joke</i>.</p>
